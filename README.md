# The Intelligent Property Investor

This is a book I'm working on.  It's not done yet.  If all goes well, I'm going to package it up as an eBook on Amazon.  In the meantime, enjoy!

## Description

Property is a marginal investment, it tracks inflation over the long term.  We're in the midst of another round of property euphoria, the painful lessons of 2008 apparently completely forgotten.  This book provides a rational analysis of the returns an investor can expect in the property market.  

The method is simple, combine carefully chosen acquisitions with thoughtful management and leverage.  The goal should be ROE, not cash flow.  If you're lucky enough to encounter a rising market and low interest rates you'll do better.  This high level analysis is supported by real life examples from 2012 to present, including detailed cost analysis of actual rental properties.
