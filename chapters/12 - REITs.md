## REITs

Earlier we discussed how long term real estate returns equal inflation.  REITs that are made up of un-leveraged property therefore cannot outpace inflation.  They're a pretty dismal investment.

The proponents of REITs will often argue they pay amazing dividends.  And, in some cases that's true.  Once again, if un-leveraged, those dividends must decrease over time.

Leveraged REITs exist.  An excellent example is the, appropriately named, Chimera Investments (CIM) REIT.  Its holdings seem to be a terrifying hodgepodge of derivatives on property.  At the same time, something like that seems the only possible way to outpace inflation in the world of REITs.
