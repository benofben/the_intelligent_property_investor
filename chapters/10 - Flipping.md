## Flipping

> Nothing sedates rationality like large doses of effortless money. -Warren Buffet

HGTV has taught us that the way to make money is real estate is flipping.  This is a horrible horrible lie.  As we saw in Selling, there are numerous transaction costs that make it difficult to extract a return.

The most prominent flippers are on TV.  I'd encourage the reader to ask the question prompted at the beginning of this book: how do the flippers make money.  I'd wager that the prominent TV flippers don't make money from their supposed business, but from the TV show itself and then connected businesses like furniture lines.  

That's not to say there aren't flippers making a living, they're just not on TV.

The flipper model seems to be:

* Buy a house, preferably cheap, perhaps at auction
* Give it a laminate and granite makeover
* Sell it at a premium

Flippers typically don't use traditional financing mechanisms, so all the wonderful characteristics of real estate as a complex financial instrument don't apply.  Instead, they may buy with cash or with cash loaned by a lender dedicated to flippers.  These lenders typically charge high fees and lend for less than a year.

Flipping works well in a rising market, because the market can cover mistakes and transaction costs.  In a flat market it's incredibly difficult to turn a profit, in a falling market it's nearly impossible.

Most flippers do incredibly substandard work.  They buy houses in poor condition.  When completely forced, they may bring things up to code, but typically they prefer to spend on finishes.  Flipped houses are usually covered in cheap finishes with serious work like furnace, plumbing or electrical missing.  The 1122 24th house described earlier is an excellent example of this.

Flippers do have one potential area where they can add value.  Most homebuyers are buying on credit.  Lending options are pretty poor for construction loans.  For example, a loan for $100k might have a 3% interest rate.  If one adds a $10k construction loan to that, the total loan for $110k might have a substantially worse interest rate, perhaps 6%.  Additionally numerous rules will be enforced on how that $10k for construction can be spent.

Banks haven't provided buyers with viable financial instruments to remodel a house they're buying on credit.  Some might argue that's a good thing, but the result is an opening for flippers.  They can come in, buy a house for $500k, put $50k of work into it and then charge $600k, a $50k premium because cash poor buyers have no alternative.

That construction arbitrage seems to be the only value flippers offer.  If possible, it's probably best to both avoid being a flipper or purchasing their output.
