"Buy land, they're not making it anymore." -Mark Twain

In mid November of 2013, I'd been living in 2324 1st for a few months.  I'd also just rented 1420 Terry at a market rate.  Happy with how I'd done in the condo market, I wanted to buy a house that would be reasonably permanent.  After years of moving around, I really wanted to settle down.

Because of the Roundpoint disaster, Chris suggested a mortgage broker he liked, Jenn.  She prequalified me for a loan.  The rules always seem to be changing.  I've heard mortgage brokers claim that 28% or 35% DTI are hard limits, then seen others willing to lend at 55%.

The rates themselves seem to have a variety of nonlinearities in them.  For instance, as I write this, in 2017, it's possible to borrow up to $600k with 5% down.  Once that threshold is passed, 10% down seems to be a requirement.  Similarly, in 2013 Jenn's firm was able to lend up to $417k at 3% down.  Once that threshold was passed, the downpayment increased.  I'd love to write down some rules about how all this works, but there seems to be no method.

Even stranger things happen at the extremes.  In 2012, Mark Zuckerberg took out a [$5.95m 30 year adjustable rate mortgage with an interest rate of 1.05%](http://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Mark-Zuckerberg-s-mortgage-rate-1-05-3711118.php).  His risk of default is essentially zero, so it's not a bad bet.  However, the margins on that loan must be razor thin.  Perhaps the bank did it to earn other aspects of his business.

Mortgage markets seem to be incredibly inefficient.  By asking a mortgage broker questions, it's possible to gather a picture of the current state of the market.  Understanding rates and downpayments vary with purchase price is probably most important.  Changes in credit score cause additional nonlinearities.  It's quite possible that a difference in purchase price of $10k could cost 10x that over 30 years.

Currently sites that aggregate mortgage listings like Zillow offer relatively little in analysis.  They'll show graphs of how the rate has changed over some period.  They don't help you model what sort of loan makes sense for you in any meaningful way.  Showing how small changes in purchase price could have an outsized impact of overall cost would be valuable for consumers.  Similarly, there are some rather obvious benefits to providing suggestions to optimize the loan.  For instance "if you pay off this $5k bill on your credit card then your credit score will rise 20 points and that will save you $20k in interest."

Consumers and disruptors like Zillow and Redfin have a vested interest in increasing the efficiency of the mortgage market.  Charitably, brokers and lenders are suffering from the innovators dilemma, where they can't stomach giving up margin to increase volume.  Less charitably, they may not have the technical expertise required to improve things.

With a preapproval in hand, Chris and I set out to see some houses.  I'd been spending way too much time looking at Redfin.  In 2013, if you set the filters to show only single family houses under $500k most of Seattle showed nothing.  The houses nearest to Seattle that fit the bill were in the southern parts of West Seattle, down toward White Center, by Tukwilla or up north past Green Lake.  There was one notable exception, the Central District, sometimes referred to as the CD.

I hadn't spent a lot of time there.  When I lived in Graham's basement on Mercer Island, I used to bike through the CD on the way to Capitol Hill.  Similarly, I'd pass through on the way to Madison Park to go kayaking, never really stopping.  The only time I'd ever spent in the CD was an informal Kimya Dawson concert held at her house.  I remember her taking a break to breast feed her newborn.

The CD was historically black.  Many Seattle neighborhoods had housing covenants that restricted ownership, or even the ability to rent.  One of these covenants that makes my skin crawl is from Clyde Hill, a neighborhood over by Bellevue.  It reads: "This property shall not be resold, leased, rented or occupied except to or by persons of the Aryan race."  The covenant is dated September 3rd, 1946, otherwise known as VJ day.  Clearly we, as a society, didn't learn everything that might be hoped from WWII.

The lower house prices in the CD were clearly tied to this history.  

The CD wasn't a terrible place in 2013, but it wasn't exactly nice either.  On hearing I intended to buy there, a longtime Seattle resident exclaimed, "oh, you mean the crime district."

I gave Chris a list of 8 houses.  My top choice was [2912 E Cherry](https://www.redfin.com/WA/Seattle/2912-E-Cherry-St-98122/home/146805), a 1905 Craftsman than had been converted into a hair salon.  It was right on Cherry by a small clump of shops in a traditionally Ethiopian neighborhood.  It went pending almost immediately, so I never even got a chance to offer.  From looking at the property records, it doesn't appear that sale ever went through.  Perhaps more patience was in order.

Many of the houses in the CD were in terrible shape.  They'd been built as serviceable Craftsman from 1900-1910 and then experienced a full century of neglect.  The ones that had been neglected alone were usually the best.  Others received the full neglect treatment in addition to periodic bizarre renovations, often involving cutting rooms up or adding questionable additions.  

A particularly egregious example of this was [1818 30th Ave](https://www.redfin.com/WA/Seattle/1818-30th-Ave-98122/home/148193).  At one point it'd been a Craftsman next to a cute park.  Since then the decks had been enclosed to create additional living space.  Multiple kitchens had been added.  The house was a maze.  Walking through it, I'd periodically hear Chris shout "I found another room!"

1818 30th sold in 2013 for $375K and was promptly bulldozed.  The new construction that replaced it sold in 2017 for $1.565m.
