> Buy land, they're not making it anymore. -Mark Twain

In mid November of 2013, I'd been living in 2324 1st for a few months.  I'd also just rented 1420 Terry at a market rate.  Happy with how I'd done in the condo market, I wanted to buy a house that would be reasonably permanent.  After years of moving around, I really wanted to settle down.

Because of the Roundpoint disaster, Chris suggested a mortgage broker he liked, Jenn.  She prequalified me for a loan.  The rules always seem to be changing.  I've heard mortgage brokers claim that 28% or 35% DTI are hard limits, then seen others willing to lend at 55%.

The rates themselves seem to have a variety of nonlinearities in them.  For instance, as I write this, in 2017, it's possible to borrow up to $600k with 5% down.  Once that threshold is passed, 10% down seems to be a requirement.  Similarly, in 2013 Jenn's firm was able to lend up to $417k at 3% down.  Once that threshold was passed, the downpayment increased.  I'd love to write down some rules about how all this works, but there seems to be no method.

Even stranger things happen at the extremes.  In 2012, Mark Zuckerberg took out a [$5.95m 30 year adjustable rate mortgage with an interest rate of 1.05%](http://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Mark-Zuckerberg-s-mortgage-rate-1-05-3711118.php).  His risk of default is essentially zero, so it's not a bad bet.  However, the margins on that loan must be razor thin.  Perhaps the bank did it to earn other aspects of his business.

Mortgage markets seem to be incredibly inefficient.  By asking a mortgage broker questions, it's possible to gather a picture of the current state of the market.  Understanding rates and downpayments vary with purchase price is probably most important.  Changes in credit score cause additional nonlinearities.  It's quite possible that a difference in purchase price of $10k could cost 10x that over 30 years.

Currently sites that aggregate mortgage listings like Zillow offer relatively little in analysis.  They'll show graphs of how the rate has changed over some period.  They don't help you model what sort of loan makes sense for you in any meaningful way.  Showing how small changes in purchase price could have an outsized impact of overall cost would be valuable for consumers.  Similarly, there are some rather obvious benefits to providing suggestions to optimize the loan.  For instance "if you pay off this $5k bill on your credit card then your credit score will rise 20 points and that will save you $20k in interest."

Consumers and disruptors like Zillow and Redfin have a vested interest in increasing the efficiency of the mortgage market.  Charitably, brokers and lenders are suffering from the innovators dilemma, where they can't stomach giving up margin to increase volume.  Less charitably, they may not have the technical expertise required to improve things.

With a preapproval in hand, Chris and I set out to see some houses.  I'd been spending way too much time looking at Redfin.  In 2013, if you set the filters to show only single family houses under $500k most of Seattle showed nothing.  The houses nearest to Seattle that fit the bill were in the southern parts of West Seattle, down toward White Center, by Tukwilla or up north past Green Lake.  There was one notable exception, the Central District, sometimes referred to as the CD.

I hadn't spent a lot of time there.  When I lived in Graham's basement on Mercer Island, I used to bike through the CD on the way to Capitol Hill.  Similarly, I'd pass through on the way to Madison Park to go kayaking, never really stopping.  The only time I'd ever spent in the CD was an informal Kimya Dawson concert held at her house.  I remember her taking a break to breast feed her newborn.

The CD was historically black.  Many Seattle neighborhoods had housing covenants that restricted ownership, or even the ability to rent.  One of these covenants that makes my skin crawl is from Clyde Hill, a neighborhood over by Bellevue.  It reads: "This property shall not be resold, leased, rented or occupied except to or by persons of the Aryan race."  The covenant is dated September 3rd, 1946, otherwise known as VJ day.  Clearly we, as a society, didn't learn everything that might be hoped from WWII.

The lower house prices in the CD were clearly tied to this history.  On hearing I intended to buy there, a longtime Seattle resident exclaimed, "oh, you mean the crime district."

![2912 E Cherry](/images/4/2912%20E%20Cherry.jpg)

I gave Chris a list of 8 houses.  My top choice was [2912 E Cherry](https://www.redfin.com/WA/Seattle/2912-E-Cherry-St-98122/home/146805), a 1905 Craftsman than had been converted into a hair salon.  It was right on Cherry by a small clump of shops in a traditionally Ethiopian neighborhood.  It went pending almost immediately, so I never even got a chance to offer.  From looking at the property records, it doesn't appear that sale ever went through.  Perhaps more patience was in order.

Many of the houses in the CD were in terrible shape.  They'd been built as serviceable Craftsman from 1900-1910 and then experienced a full century of neglect.  The ones that had been neglected alone were usually the best.  Others received the full neglect treatment in addition to periodic bizarre renovations, often involving cutting rooms up or adding questionable additions.  

A particularly egregious example of this was [1818 30th Ave](https://www.redfin.com/WA/Seattle/1818-30th-Ave-98122/home/148193).  At one point it'd been a Craftsman next to a cute park.  Since then the decks had been enclosed to create additional living space.  Multiple kitchens had been added.  The house was a maze.  Walking through it, I'd periodically hear Chris shout "I found another room!"

![1818 30th](/images/4/1818%2030th.jpg)

1818 30th sold in 2013 for $375K and was promptly bulldozed.  The new construction that replaced it sold in 2017 for $1.565m.

![169 19th](/images/4/169%2019th.jpg)

I really liked a 1901 Craftsman at [169 19th](https://www.redfin.com/WA/Seattle/169-19th-Ave-98122/home/145032).  The neighborhood was still pretty well in the ghetto in 2014.  The house itself was poorly maintained, but hadn't had anything particularly weird done to it.  The last major renovation appeared to be a wood paneled kitchen that appeared to date from the 80s.  The house was mostly empty, but the owners daughter was living on an air bed in one room.

The house was owned by an older woman named Dorothy.  She and her husband Gilberto originally bought in 1986 for $30k.  Tax records showed they divorced in 2007 and she got the house.  Along the way her debt against the house grew to $250k.  Initially I assumed that was the result of poor decisions with home equity loans.  To add insult, both the hot water heater and furnace were leased.  I hadn't even realized that was possible.

The lot was incredibly small.  Researching the tax records with Chris, it became apparent that Dorothy, the owner, had subdivided the lot.  She now owned two townhouses built in what had previously been the back yard.

![169 19th - Kitchen](/images/4/169%2019th%20-%20Kitchen.jpg)

Given the condition of the house, the asking price of $499,950 was far too much.  It would have been about the right price if recently remodeled.  The contractor who'd helped out twice previously, Mike, did a walk through and estimated $150k to bring everything up to speed.  In an attempt to avoid crossing the $400k barrier, we put together an offer for $406k.  Dorothy countered with a slight discount off her asking price.  We walked away.  

I still believe what she was asking in December 2013 was ridiculous.  But, by March 2014 she'd sold it for her asking price.  It had to hang around on the market for a few months, but she was right.  Between that cash out and the two town houses, she's probably done quite well.

![1122 24th](/images/4/1122%2024th.jpg)

Chris and I had previously looked at [1122 24th Ave](https://www.redfin.com/WA/Seattle/1122-24th-Ave-98122/home/146674).  It's a 1903 Craftsman on right by a commercial area in the CD.  The nearest intersection is 24th and Union.  Seattle luminary Sir Mix-a-Lot wrote this about the the intersection of 23rd and Union in 1988:

> Cruising in this Benz and ain't got no place to go  
> Wheeling 23rd we saw nothing but thugs  
> The girlies was too skinny from smoking all them drugs  
> Cause the rock man got em and their butts just drop  
> The freaks look depressed because the Benz won't stop  
> At 23rd and Union the driver broke left  
> Kevin shouted Broadway it's time to get def  

Directly across the street from 1122 was Midtown Center.  It's a shopping center that previously housed a bunch of shops and a USPS sorting center.  As of 2014 it was largely vacant, though had a barber and a liquor store.  The parking lot was popular with drug dealers who would hang out for hours in gas guzzling relics from the 80s with giant rims.  Another corner had some boarded houses, across the street from that a drive through bank.  The bank had been the first black owned bank in Seattle before being bought by KeyBank and eventually closed.

At the intersection of 23rd and Union one corner lot consisted of a fenced of field.  Across the street from that was a gas station.  Yet another corner had previously been a Philly Cheesesteak shop, but was now vacant.  The corner of that building had bullet holes in it.  Next to that were a church and a drive through car wash.  

The UMOJA Peace Center was across the street.  What exactly the peace center did is unclear to me, but it was run by a friendly man named Omari who filled his yard with brightly colored plastic tows.  As an act of neighborhood goodwill, he regularly mowed the planter strips for the entire block with a push mower.

A dive bar called Thompson's Point of View had been replaced by a more friendly dive bar called the Neighbor Lady.  Cortona coffee was on the corner of 25th and Union nearby.  And, the edges of Capitol Hill were relatively close at 13th and Union, marked by a restaurant called Zoe.  Every year the edges of Capitol Hill seemed to move a bit further up the hill towards the CD.  Similarly the soccer mom haven of Madrona was another world and relatively nearby at 34th and Union.

![Upzone](/images/4/Upzone.jpg)

Much of the area under review to be upzoned or about to be bulldozed.  The picture above is from just two years later and shows the various projects completed or in progress at that time.

The house itself was on a double lot.  It had been purchased by a flipper named Julien in March 2013 for $275k.  He'd done this through an LLC based in Las Vegas.  He'd done a good job with the house cosmetically.  The kitchen and bathrooms had been completely redone.  There was new paint, the flooring was refinished.  He'd also had the base finished.

It was then listed in September.  By the time I was looking at it seriously, the price had been through a number of revisions.

Sep 4, 2013, $484,950
Sep 9, 2013, $474,999
Sep 18, 2013, $469,999
Sep 24, 2013, $464,999
Sep 30, 2013, $459,000
Oct 3, 2013, $449,950
Nov 21, 2013, $444,950
Dec 4, 2013, $439,950
Dec 11, 2013, $434,950

![1122 Staging](/images/4/1122%20Staging.jpg)

There are many reasons it languished on the market so long.  The main one is that the price was too high.  Julien had the inside of the house completed, but had visibly cut corners on the landscaping.  An extra few thousand dollars spent on shrubs and cleanup would have made an enormous difference.  The listing pictures were also pretty bad and the staging was absolutely bizarre.  Instead of beds, there were piles of pillows.  Lawn furniture was used inside, presumably because it's lighter weight.  One bedroom was staged solely with a fake potted plant in the corner.

Our initial offer was at $397k.  After a bit of haggling we ended up with a mutually accepted offer at $425k.
