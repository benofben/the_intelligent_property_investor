> Buy land, they're not making it anymore. -Mark Twain

In mid November of 2013, I'd been living in 2324 1st for a few months.  I'd also just rented 1420 Terry at a market rate.  Happy with how I'd done in the condo market, I wanted to buy a house that would be reasonably permanent.  After years of moving around, I really wanted to settle down.

Because of the Roundpoint disaster, Chris suggested a mortgage broker he liked, Jenn.  She prequalified me for a loan.  The rules always seem to be changing.  I've heard mortgage brokers claim that 28% or 35% DTI are hard limits, then seen others willing to lend at 55%.

The rates themselves seem to have a variety of nonlinearities in them.  For instance, as I write this, in 2017, it's possible to borrow up to $600k with 5% down.  Once that threshold is passed, 10% down seems to be a requirement.  Similarly, in 2013 Jenn's firm was able to lend up to $417k at 3% down.  Once that threshold was passed, the downpayment increased.  I'd love to write down some rules about how all this works, but there seems to be no method.

Even stranger things happen at the extremes.  In 2012, Mark Zuckerberg took out a [$5.95m 30 year adjustable rate mortgage with an interest rate of 1.05%](http://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Mark-Zuckerberg-s-mortgage-rate-1-05-3711118.php).  His risk of default is essentially zero, so it's not a bad bet.  However, the margins on that loan must be razor thin.  Perhaps the bank did it to earn other aspects of his business.

Mortgage markets seem to be incredibly inefficient.  By asking a mortgage broker questions, it's possible to gather a picture of the current state of the market.  Understanding rates and downpayments vary with purchase price is probably most important.  Changes in credit score cause additional nonlinearities.  It's quite possible that a difference in purchase price of $10k could cost 10x that over 30 years.

Currently sites that aggregate mortgage listings like Zillow offer relatively little in analysis.  They'll show graphs of how the rate has changed over some period.  They don't help you model what sort of loan makes sense for you in any meaningful way.  Showing how small changes in purchase price could have an outsized impact of overall cost would be valuable for consumers.  Similarly, there are some rather obvious benefits to providing suggestions to optimize the loan.  For instance "if you pay off this $5k bill on your credit card then your credit score will rise 20 points and that will save you $20k in interest."

Consumers and disruptors like Zillow and Redfin have a vested interest in increasing the efficiency of the mortgage market.  Charitably, brokers and lenders are suffering from the innovators dilemma, where they can't stomach giving up margin to increase volume.  Less charitably, they may not have the technical expertise required to improve things.

With a preapproval in hand, Chris and I set out to see some houses.  I'd been spending way too much time looking at Redfin.  In 2013, if you set the filters to show only single family houses under $500k most of Seattle showed nothing.  The houses nearest to Seattle that fit the bill were in the southern parts of West Seattle, down toward White Center, by Tukwilla or up north past Green Lake.  There was one notable exception, the Central District, sometimes referred to as the CD.

I hadn't spent a lot of time there.  When I lived in Graham's basement on Mercer Island, I used to bike through the CD on the way to Capitol Hill.  Similarly, I'd pass through on the way to Madison Park to go kayaking, never really stopping.  The only time I'd ever spent in the CD was an informal Kimya Dawson concert held at her house.  I remember her taking a break to breast feed her newborn.

![schmidt black 1920](/images/4/schmidt%20black%201920.png)

The CD was historically black.  Many Seattle neighborhoods had housing covenants that restricted ownership, or even the ability to rent.  One of these covenants that makes my skin crawl is from Clyde Hill, a neighborhood over by Bellevue.  It reads: "This property shall not be resold, leased, rented or occupied except to or by persons of the Aryan race."  The covenant is dated September 3rd, 1946, otherwise known as VJ day.  Clearly we, as a society, didn't learn everything that might be hoped from WWII.

The lower house prices in the CD were clearly tied to this history.  On hearing I intended to buy there, a longtime Seattle resident exclaimed, "oh, you mean the crime district."

![2912 E Cherry](/images/4/2912%20E%20Cherry.jpg)

I gave Chris a list of 8 houses.  My top choice was [2912 E Cherry](https://www.redfin.com/WA/Seattle/2912-E-Cherry-St-98122/home/146805), a 1905 Craftsman than had been converted into a hair salon.  It was right on Cherry by a small clump of shops in a traditionally Ethiopian neighborhood.  It went pending almost immediately, so I never even got a chance to offer.  From looking at the property records, it doesn't appear that sale ever went through.  Perhaps more patience was in order.

Many of the houses in the CD were in terrible shape.  They'd been built as serviceable Craftsman from 1900-1910 and then experienced a full century of neglect.  The ones that had been neglected alone were usually the best.  Others received the full neglect treatment in addition to periodic bizarre renovations, often involving cutting rooms up or adding questionable additions.  

A particularly egregious example of this was [1818 30th Ave](https://www.redfin.com/WA/Seattle/1818-30th-Ave-98122/home/148193).  At one point it'd been a Craftsman next to a cute park.  Since then the decks had been enclosed to create additional living space.  Multiple kitchens had been added.  The house was a maze.  Walking through it, I'd periodically hear Chris shout "I found another room!"

![1818 30th](/images/4/1818%2030th.jpg)

1818 30th sold in 2013 for $375K and was promptly bulldozed.  The new construction that replaced it sold in 2017 for $1.565m.

![169 19th](/images/4/169%2019th.jpg)

I really liked a 1901 Craftsman at [169 19th](https://www.redfin.com/WA/Seattle/169-19th-Ave-98122/home/145032).  The neighborhood was still pretty well in the ghetto in 2014.  The house itself was poorly maintained, but hadn't had anything particularly weird done to it.  The last major renovation appeared to be a wood paneled kitchen that likely dated from the 80s.  The house was mostly empty, but the owner's daughter was living on an air bed in one room.

The house was owned by an older woman named Dorothy.  She and her husband Gilberto originally bought in 1986 for $30k.  Tax records showed they divorced in 2007 and she got the house.  Along the way her debt against the house grew to $250k.  Initially I assumed that was the result of poor decisions with home equity loans.  To add insult, both the hot water heater and furnace were leased from the utility company.  I hadn't even realized that was possible.

The lot was incredibly small.  Researching the tax records with Chris, it became apparent that Dorothy, the owner, had subdivided the lot.  She now owned two townhouses built in what had previously been the back yard.

![169 19th - Kitchen](/images/4/169%2019th%20-%20Kitchen.jpg)

Given the condition of the house, the asking price of $499,950 was far too much.  It would have been about the right price if recently remodeled.  The contractor who'd helped out twice previously, Mike, did a walk through and estimated $150k to bring everything up to speed.  In an attempt to avoid crossing the $400k barrier, we put together an offer for $406k.  Dorothy countered with a slight discount off her asking price.  We walked away.  

I still believe what she was asking in December 2013 was ridiculous.  But, by March 2014 she'd sold it for her asking price.  It had to hang around on the market for a few months, but she was right.  Between that cash out and the two town houses, she's probably done quite well.

![1122 24th](/images/4/1122%2024th.jpg)

Chris and I had previously looked at [1122 24th Ave](https://www.redfin.com/WA/Seattle/1122-24th-Ave-98122/home/146674).  It's a 1903 Craftsman by a commercial area in the CD.  The nearest intersection is 24th and Union.  Seattle luminary Sir Mix-a-Lot had this to say about the area in 1988:

> Cruising in this Benz and ain't got no place to go  
> Wheeling 23rd we saw nothing but thugs  
> The girlies was too skinny from smoking all them drugs  
> Cause the rock man got em and their butts just drop  
> The freaks look depressed because the Benz won't stop  
> At 23rd and Union the driver broke left  
> Kevin shouted Broadway it's time to get def  

Directly across the street from 1122 was Midtown Center.  It's a shopping center that previously housed a bunch of shops and a USPS sorting center.  As of 2014 it was largely vacant, though had a barber and a liquor store.  The parking lot was popular with drug dealers who would hang out for hours in gas guzzling relics from the 80s with giant rims.  Another corner had some boarded up houses and a mosque.  It perpetually had large numbers of taxis parked out front, a commentary on the profession of many Somali immigrants at the time.  Across the street from that was a drive through bank.  The bank had been the first black owned bank in Seattle before being bought by KeyBank and eventually closed.

At the intersection of 23rd and Union, one corner lot consisted of a fenced off field.  Across the street from that was a gas station.  Yet another corner had previously been a Philly Cheesesteak shop, but was now vacant.  The corner of that building had bullet holes in it.  Next to that was a church and a drive through car wash.  

The UMOJA Peace Center was across the street.  What exactly the peace center did is unclear to me, but it was run by a friendly man named Omari who filled his yard with brightly colored plastic toys.  As an act of neighborly goodwill, he regularly mowed the planter strips for the entire block with a push mower.  At one point a few years later the yard of the peace center became a homeless camp.

A notorious dive bar called Thompson's Point of View had been replaced by a more friendly dive bar called the Neighbor Lady.  Cortona coffee was on the corner of 25th and Union nearby.  The edges of hipster Capitol Hill were relatively close at 13th and Union, marked by a restaurant called Zoe.  Every year the hipster front seemed to move a bit further up the hill towards the CD.  Similarly, the soccer mom haven of Madrona was another world and relatively nearby at 34th and Union.

![Upzone](/images/4/Upzone.jpg)

Much of the area was under review to be upzoned or about to be bulldozed.  The picture above is from just two years later and shows the various projects completed or in progress at that time.  It was part of the proposal the develop the bank site.

The house itself was on a double lot.  It had been purchased by a flipper named Julian in March 2013 for $275k.  He'd done this through an LLC based in Las Vegas.  He'd done a good job with the house cosmetically.  The kitchen and bathrooms had been completely redone.  There was new paint, the flooring was refinished.  He'd also had the base finished.

It was then listed in September.  By the time I was looking at it seriously, the price had been through a number of revisions.

Sep 4, 2013, $484,950  
Sep 9, 2013, $474,999  
Sep 18, 2013, $469,999  
Sep 24, 2013, $464,999  
Sep 30, 2013, $459,000  
Oct 3, 2013, $449,950  
Nov 21, 2013, $444,950  
Dec 4, 2013, $439,950  
Dec 11, 2013, $434,950  

There are many reasons it languished on the market so long.  The main one is that the price was too high.  Julian had the inside of the house completed, but had visibly cut corners on the landscaping.  An extra few thousand dollars spent on shrubs and cleanup would have made an enormous difference.  The listing pictures were also pretty bad and the staging was absolutely bizarre.  Instead of beds, there were piles of pillows.  Bamboo patio furniture was used to stage the inside, presumably because doesn't weigh much.  One bedroom was staged solely with a fake potted plant in the corner.

![1122 Staging](/images/4/1122%20Staging.jpg)

Our initial offer was at $397k.  After a bit of haggling we ended up with a mutually accepted offer at $425k.

Julian had turned the heat off, presumably to save money.  Over Christmas the pipes exploded, damaging the kitchen and ruining the carpeting in the basement.  He agreed to replace that.  Once that work was complete, Paul did his inspection.

This time the report ran to 52 pages.  He noted a variety of issues that indicated significant corners had been cut on the remodel.  The chimney was badly eroded.  An attic vent was uncovered.  It later turned out there was a bird nest up there.  The attic was uninsulated.  More serious problems were identified with the upstairs water pressure, the furnace and the wiring.  When I asked Paul for a rough idea what he thought it would all cost he guessed $20k-$50k.

In the counter we asked for a $20k credit.  They gave us $2500.

![1122 Water](/images/4/1122%20Water.jpg)

After closing, I moved a bed into the upstairs bedroom but left the rest of the house vacant.  Mike came by to take at look at the water pressure issue.  It was so low that the shower was unusable.  With some investigation, Mike discovered that instead of a proper water main, Julien's contractor had used a rubber pipe.  It was very similar to a garden hose and certainly not up to code.  With five feet of dirt on top of it, it compacted, causing the poor water pressure.

Various other issues presented themselves and the scope of work expanded.  The return had been put next to a register, so the furnace ran endlessly while doing nothing.  That required a rework of the vents.  Given that was a necessity, replacing the furnace became worthwhile.

Similarly as the the plumber, Martyn, began working back from the water main, he encountered additional issues.  It became worthwhile to re-plumb much of the house.  The wiring hadn't been done to code either and a new breaker box was required to bring things in line.

This went on for a few months.  About once a week Mike uncovered some significant new piece of shoddy workmanship.  In March the sewer back up.  With the low water pressure we hadn't noticed the issue initially, but countless workman flushing the toilet were enough to overwhelm its anemic drainage.

Investigation uncovered a broken router in the sewer pipe.  Julian had known there was a problem.  He had not disclosed it on Form 17, a form that exists precisely for sellers to disclose issues like non functioning sewers.  The issue itself wasn't his fault.  The city had planted a tree directly on top of the sewer line in the planter strip.  It had grown into the line.  

That issue alone cost over $13k.  However, there was a happy piece of news.  Scott sued the city and was able to recover the cost.  We also requested that the city allow us to remove the tree.  The city arborist at the time declined the request despite our insistence with evidence from a variety of experts that the tree would grow into the sewer line again.  

The tree grew into the sewer again.  Three years later, in 2017 I was skiing at Crystal when I got a call from the tenants that there was water in the basement and bits of wet toilet paper on the side of the house.  I called up Mike, who was skiing at Whistler.  He recommended I move the tenants into temporary housing, which was excellent advice.  He cut his trip short and spent the next week resolving the issue.  I'm deeply appreciative of his hard work and responsiveness.  He also escalated the tree removal issue with the city, going well above the arborist.  This time they let us remove it.

The final bill came to over $20k for the second sewer episode.  Scott sued the city again.  There's probably an argument in here for better accountability in government.  Paying to redo my sewer line twice because of a poorly planted tree doesn't seem like a great use of public funds.

The Seattle area is geologically active.  There are numerous volcanos around, including Mount Rainier.  Condos typically have earthquake insurance paid for by the HOA.  Typical insurance policies for houses have no earthquake insurance.  If an earthquake were to level your house, you'd be left with a mortgage and a pile of rubble.  Houses built before 1975 don't meet modern earthquake safety standards and require a retrofit to be eligible for insurance.  There are some insurers who offer policies without a retrofit, but their premiums are enormous.

The retrofit isn't rocket science.  An engineer draws up some plans and then workman go around the basement bolting the house to the foundation and attaching metal plates various places.  That work totaled an additional $9k.

In all this I got to make a few cosmetic improvements.  The living room was closed off from the entry way.  The wall was, of course, structural.  Having it removed was expensive, but improved the layout of the house immensely.   Similarly, Julian had installed an island in the kitchen that was unusable.  Removing it opened up the space.  The floors had been stained a dark color that was trendy for the time by Julian.  A lighter stain brightened the space considerably.  Beyond that, I spent a bunch of time landscaping and picking rusty nails out of the yard.

The total payment to Mike for 2014 was about $120k with a small portion of that recovered from the sewer lawsuit.  I finally moved in properly in April, two months after closing.  The work wasn't entirely complete until August.  On numerous occasions throughout all this Mike expressed outrage at the shoddy work of the previous contractor, Lyons Built.

I consulted with Scott and a few other lawyers.  There was no legal recourse.  A recent court case had effectively neutered the buyer protection Form 17 was intended to provide.  Sellers weren't legally obligated to tell the truth on it.  Further, Julian had done all the work on the house through an LLC based in Las Vegas.  Even if I got a judgement against him in Washington, I'd have to take it Nevada, a state apparently famous among lawyers for protecting the interests of its businesses.

I couldn't go after Lyons Built either because I had no standing.  From a legal standpoint, Lyons Built had screwed Julian, not me.  As of 2017, it's unclear what's happened to Lyons Built, but Julian appears to still be in business.

There are a wide variety of reasons to do the right thing in business and in life.  The most basic reason is because it's the right thing.  If that isn't enough, there are other more pragmatic reasons.  The law is one.  Beyond that, the world is a small place.  Bad behavior has the potential to catch up with you.  Even if it doesn't result in a particular serious issue, it poisons relationships.

One of the things I've enjoyed most about investing in real estate is meeting people and building a network that I value both for their professional abilities and as friends.  As time passes, the work has gotten easier because of this network effect, allowing me to be both happier and more productive.

Dishonest people who cut corners and screw those they deal with will never get these benefits.

The $120k cost of all this easily exhausted my available cash and then some.  I financed the work through an unholy mix of credit card promo rates and unsecured personal loans.  I don't recommend it.  While the rates were pretty good, the impact to my credit score was not.  Playing musical credit cards for a while after that wasn't much fun either.

One alternative would have been a construction loan.  However, I only had 5% equity so there was nothing to tap there.  A construction loan for the entire price plus the renovations would have been possible, but the rates were punitive and came with terms about what the money could be spent on.  From what I've seen construction loans don't make sense unless you're confident of an ability to refinance when the work is complete.  I've never been confident of my ability to refinance, particularly if a significantly higher appraisal is required, as would be the case for a construction loan.  Given that I've avoided them.

1122 24th was financed with a 5% down loan.  The loan had PMI but that was prepaid as a $7k lump sum.  The interest rate was 5% with an APR of 5.042%.  Normally the GFE includes all the costs in the loan.  In this case they did something sort of slimy.  They checked a box saying that the loan requires PMI separately.  That allowed them to avoid including the $7k payment in the APR figure.  The real APR figure is significantly greater than 5.042%.  I was sloppy and didn't notice it at the time.

To this day, I have no idea why I took that loan.  It was a terrible, terrible loan.  Supposedly the prepaid PMI was to make the DTI work, but I suspect that entire issue could have been avoided simply by finding a different lender.

Lucky for me I put $120k into improving the house and had receipts from a properly licensed and bonded contractor to prove it.  Beyond that, Seattle real estate was growing like mad.  If not for that, my various missteps with 1122 24th might have done serious damage to my finances.

I was able to refinance at 4.125% with an APR of 4.152% in 2015 and again at 3.75% with an APR of 3.769% in 2016.  In each case that was as a rental property, so the rate was quite good.  Unfortunately as I'd prepaid the PMI that $7k I'd prepaid just went poof.

Both refinances were done by Jason at Catlin Capital.  The models I've built to understand real estate as an investment owe a fair bit to my discussions with Jason.  Tools like ROE are essential to comparing how different financing options will perform over time.  Taking a simple cash flow approach instead, would lead one to perpetually refinance with a mortgage payment out of Zeno's paradox and endless fees.  Jason also tells the truth about what the rate and the APR is going to be.  That's unusual in his industry.
