## How much house can I afford?

"Stocks have reached a permanently high plateau." -Irving Fisher, October 16, 1929

Don't worry.  This time it's different.  Housing has reached a permanently high plateau with demand on the costs driving prices skyward for good.  You'd better get in before the market moves on without you.  So, how much house can you afford?  Probably more than you need.  Almost certainly more than you should buy.

This, somewhat shocking, graph shows how much house you can buy depending on your annual income.  The assumption here is 5% down, %5% interest and 43% back end DTI.

Prior to the credit crunch, lending would typically be at 28% or 35% DTI depending on whether that was front end or back end.  In the madness of the run up to 2008 that all changed.  During the hangover that followed, DTI got more conservative for a bit.  During the 2015-2018 period DTIs got much looser again.  I've seen lenders that will lend at 55% or more.  

So, that 43% figure is probably conservative.  It's also too much.  If you make $100k/year you can "afford" a house that costs $702k.  There are additional costs like PMI, taxes and insurance that will bring that figure down.

Keeping up with the Joneses and buying a house that maximizes your DTI is a likely path to ruin.
