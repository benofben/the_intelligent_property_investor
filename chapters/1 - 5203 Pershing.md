# 1 - 5203 Pershing

I moved around a lot early in my career.  After finishing school in Colorado, I was lucky enough to land a job at a startup through a combination of family connections and upfront work for free.  TrakWell had headquarters in Minneapolis, but allowed me to work from Seattle.

I picked Seattle because of the coffee shops.  Growing up near the Trident in Boulder had turned me on to coffee shops.  Seattle cemented my affection for coffee shops and the neighborhoods they inhabit.  At the time my Seattle favorites were Bauhaus, Zeitgeist, Victrola and Joe Bar.

In 2005 Pioneer Square was full of decaying buildings, nightclubs and homeless shelters.  A lot of the city's artist population lived there because it was cheap and picturesque.  I rented a semi-legal loft at 89 Yesler for $1200/month.  I loved living in that loft, but I couldn't quite afford it.  

According to the [HUD](https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/comm_planning/affordablehousing/): "Families who pay more than 30 percent of their income for housing are considered cost burdened and may have difficulty affording necessities such as food, clothing, transportation and medical care."

At the time I was making $40k/year.  That felt like a staggering sum.  However, doing the math: ($1,200*12)/$40,000 = 36%.  The difficulties of rent burden weren't immediately clear.  I bought a dining set from Crate and Barrel, two couches from Dana and the Edo Bed from Area 51.  I'd been eyeing the bed for years at that point.  A store in Boulder had it in their display window.  For the first time in my life I had a fully furnished space that was mine alone.

Of course, things were too tight. I asked my dad for help a couple times.  Then TrakWell went out of business.  There was no announcement.  Instead an expense check was late.  Then a paycheck.  Then another.  I couldn't get my boss on the phone or the CEO.  With the 12 month lease on 89 Yesler up, I took a job in Chicago with TIBCO.

From then on I had a variety of strange living situations.  My time in Chicago was spent at a Homewood Suites in the outer suburb of Schaumburg, paid for by the company.  From there I went to New York.  Initially I lived in an overpriced sublet at 2nd Ave and 11th St.  I think my only furniture was a futon on the floor.  A few weeks before the sublet expired, the company gave me the opportunity to travel to South Africa for work.  I jumped on it, but that meant cleaning out the sublet early.  Fortunately my friend Graham had a Zipcar subscription.  We loaded all my stuff in a pickup and stuffed it in a storage area.

I spent a month or so working in South Africa, followed by several weeks in London.  When I got back to New York I needed a new place to live.  My friend Michelle had a one bedroom railroad apartment at 6th and B.  She rented me her living room for $800/month.  Michelle's ex-boyfriend, Blair, had a rent controlled apartment at 11th and C.  He moved to LA and wanted to sublet it.  At the time NYC allowed subletting for the rent control price plus $50/month to cover administrative costs.

At some point the apartment got bedbugs.  Even just typing that, I can feel them running up and down my legs.  Because there was no washer/dryer, it was difficult to follow the typical advice for dealing with bed bugs.  Instead, I took to dry cleaning everything.  Then construction started next door.  A new building went up flush against my windows, blocking out light for most of the apartment and creating deafening noise twelve hours a day.

After a few months there, TIBCO offered me a job in London.  I jumped on the opportunity and immediately packed up the NYC apartment.  I had been slightly less than a year.  I explained the situation to Blair with sixty days notice and said I'd be happy to forfeit my security deposit.  He responded by saying I'd ruined his life.  It sounds like things were tough for him.  He moved back from LA.  A year or two later I heard he'd died.  Clearly there's more to that particular story.

Rent control is full of unintended consequences.  In my case it helped subsidize my early career.  While helpful to me, the Puerto Rican families in that building needed the assistance more than I did.  One person I know had a rent controlled apartment that he sublet illegally, charging a significant markup.  He collected welfare in the US while living in Germany collecting reparations there.  Abuse like that makes me think a universal basic income would be a better way to ensure basic needs are met.

The UK had a waiting period for work permits that TIBCO and I hadn't known about.  I'd recently been to London and needed to wait out of the country for three months while the permit processed.  During that time I couldn't work for TIBCO UK.  I spent the three months helping out with some projects in Washington DC and living in my friend Nate's attic in Wallingford outside of Seattle when not traveling.  When the permit finally cleared, I hopped on a plane to London and began working while looking for a flat.

Once again it was really easy to become rent burdened.  London is one of the most expensive cities in the world.  In 2007 the economy was booming.  A coworker suggested I look for a two bedroom in Notting Hill or nearby.  That way I'd have space for friends to visit.  I couldn't afford that.  Besides, Notting Hill was boring and lacked coffee shops.  

I had a ₤10,000 relocation budget.  At the time the exchange rate was about 2.1, so it felt like a massive sum.  Some of it went to shipping a portion of my belongings to the UK.  The remainder allowed me about 30 days of hotel and expenses.  

Things that had never been a problem in the US were huge issues.  A number of banks denied my application to open a checking account because of my lack of credit history.  I still have a hard time understanding that one.  Citibank eventually let me open an account on the basis of my US credit and a letter of reference from TIBCO.  When I applied for a UK credit card I was denied.  A ₤100 prepaid card was suggested as an alternative.  I pushed American Express to contact their US organization.  Once they did that I was suddenly approved for a ₤10,000 card.

Without a current account or credit card it would have been incredibly difficult to get started in the UK.  Letters of reference from my employer, a significant income and references from the US all helped me work around that.  The experience was an unsettling window into how poverty is self perpetuating.

With my accounts in place, I settled on a three story shared flat in Fullwoods Mews.  The ground floor had two bedrooms.  The second floor had a large living room and a kitchen.  The top floor had two more bedrooms.  The tenants were constantly changing.  

I remember three quite well.  Laurence was from East London.  He worked in a boiler room selling questionable stocks to the unwitting.  He also had a tendency to get into bar fights about football.  One night he came home missing a tooth.  When I announced I could care less about football, he informed me I was henceforward an Arsenal fan.  Kristina was Finnish and worked for the FSA, the UK equivalent of the SEC.  Laurence was incredibly wary of her.  Upstairs was Nick, a fellow American who fits many of the stereotypes of Americans abroad, but is so friendly he's impossible to dislike.

The flat had paper thin walls.  After a few months of settling into London I wanted my own space.  A studio next door in the same building came up.  I moved in there.  It had paper thin walls too.  I could hear every step above me.

I'd spent a lot of time walking around the city and noticed what I thought was a pricing anomaly.  East London had a number of abandoned pubs.  The downstairs would typically be beautiful old wood, polished by a thousand hands holding and spilling their beer.  Upstairs might be additional dining space or even living space.  Sometimes they were partially burnt out.  Some were available for ₤500k-₤1M.  I tried to apply for a mortgage.  Several brokers told me it was impossible as a foreigner.  Others asked for down payments in excess of 30%, something I could not have afforded.  I quickly gave up the dream of home ownership in the UK.  That was in 2009, at the bottom of the credit crunch.  As of this writing, those buildings have all been restored all demolished.  Restored pubs are worth millions.  Interestingly, during this time, my American ex-roomate, Nick, was able to buy a small studio in Kensington.  I suspect he's done well with that investment.

After a bit over a year in Fullwoods Mews I moved out of Zone 1 to a beautiful flat at 74 Broadway Market.  I was upstairs from a hair salon, across the street from a coffee shop and next door to the pub.  It even had a washer/dryer that more or less worked.  My only complaint was that on weekends the pub stayed open until 1am.  Of course most weekends I was at the pub or the cocktail bar Off Broadway next door, so it wasn't a big deal.  On Saturdays the street would close for a market with vendors selling saucisson, apple cider and even really good churros.

Living in London was strangely alienating.  While I had an amazing time at Broadway Market, I learned I would always be a foreigner.  Even if I was wearing a perfectly tailored suit, the moment I opened my mouth it would be clear from my accent that I didn't belong.  I took to wearing cowboy boots with my suits.  They were great for walking around the city and I discovered that fitting into stereotypes could be more useful than fitting in.

I wanted to move home.  Nothing will make you more patriotic than living in another country.  TIBCO offered me a few choices for 2011.  Singapore and the US were both on the table.  I missed home so much that I stupidly chose the US.  In the US my choices were Atlanta and Dallas.  My love of cowboy boots probably figured into the Dallas choice.  The lack of a state income tax didn't hurt either.

After years of living in questionable places with terrible, failing or absent appliances and nonfunctional heating and cooling, Dallas was paradise.  I toured numerous high-end mid-rise apartment buildings that I could easily afford and ending up selecting a one bedroom at The Ashton in Uptown.  The bathroom was bigger than my studio in London.

In Dallas I learned the phrase credit card millionaire.  That's a person who lives like a millionaire off of ever increasing credit card debt.  The lease at The Ashton seems designed for credit card millionaires.  Rent was $2750/month but the lease included the first two months free.  Doing the math that works out to (10*2750)/12 = $2291.67/month.  This was less than I'd been paying in London for a much nicer place.  It even had a dishwasher, something I hadn't had in years.

The Ashton offered two options for paying the rent:
* Pay $0 for the first two months and $2750 for the next ten months
* Pay $2291.67 for each of the 12 months

I chose the first option.  To pick, I viewed the baseline as option (2).  With that baseline, option (1) is then a 0% loan of the first two months rent.  If someone wants to loan you money for free, you should always take it.  Option (2) only makes sense for people with money management problems.  However, if you can't manage your cash flow to accommodate a 0% loan, you probably shouldn't be renting a luxury apartment.

Things were going really well.  I also bought a fancy car, a 2006 Lotus Elise.

Work at TIBCO went well and I got transferred to a new group, supporting financial services again as I had been in New York and London before.  That was a blast and I was really enjoying Dallas.  I'd also discovered an area of Dallas that reminded me a bit of Seattle, the East Village and Broadway Market.  It's called Knox-Henderson.  My favorite coffee shop was the Pearl Cup there.  It's now closed, but a new coffee shop is currently operating in the same space called Houndstooth Coffee.

I'd been looking at property for years, but had never been able to buy.  Returning to the US my financials were in good shape.  I had a solid income.  I still had a few years on my student loans, but the $412 monthly payment was manageable.  The loans were at rates between 2% and 3%, so were effectively free money.  I had no credit card debt.  The car payment was also manageable, about $300/month.  I was able to put the maximum payments towards both my IRA and 401k.

I had accounts at HSBC and Wells Fargo.  I called both to check rates.  This was 2011 and lending was just starting to ramp up again after the credit crunch.  I still remember a conversation with the bank where they were surprised at how high my credit score was.  Surprise quickly shifted to excitement as they approved me for a loan with the maximum debt to income at the time.  The loan was an FHA with 3.5% down.  I think the rate was about 3.5% as well.

Preapproval in hand, I fired up Redfin and found an agent.  Agents are in business because of regulatory capture.  The details vary a bit state by state.  In Washington the seller of a property pays 6% of the sale price.  3% goes to the listing agent and 3% to the buyer's agent.  For less expensive properties, those commissions are reasonable.  As the property price increases, the commission quickly accelerates to madness.

If you buy a house for $300k, your agent will make $9k.  Depending on how difficult a client you were, that could either be a great hourly rate or something more marginal.  But, it's in the ballpark.  However, if you buy a house for $3m that same commission is $180k.  The agent didn't do meaningfully more work for the more expensive house.

Redfin has changed the model a bit by refunding a portion of the agent's fee.  At the time they were refunding half of that fee, or 1.5% of the purchase price.

Before the internet, agents added a lot of value.  They knew the neighborhoods and could walk you through what listings fits your criteria.  Today you're better off just browsing to redfin.com or zillow.com and picking through the available inventory yourself.  Some less scrupulous agents will claim they have special knowledge of listings.  They don't.  Everything goes in the Multiple Listing Service (MLS).  Redfin and Zillow list everything in the MLS.

Some agents will claim they can help you negotiating.  Don't trust them.  Your incentives are not aligned.  A buyer's agent paid on commission is incentivized to have you buy something expensive quickly.  They have no incentive to help you get the best price, they simply want to see you transact for as much as possible.

In short, don't trust your agent.  They are a necessary evil.  They're useful for submitting offers and working through the steps of closing a deal, but their incentives are not aligned with yours.  Don't forget it.
