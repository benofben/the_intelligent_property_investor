# The Low End

Apparently there's money to be made as a "slum lord."  The idea has never appealed to me.  I like to take pride in what I do, the network of contractors I employ and the services I offer to my tenants.  Slowly killing them while they try to live in a molding cesspool doesn't seem like a good way to accomplish that.

Offering quality housing for a fair price seems a much better way to go about the business of real estate.  Evicted by Matthew Desmond offers a detailed window into slum lords and their finances.  It seems he wrote the book more to explore the human angle, but the economic side comes out at well.  

One surprising point was that even the most successful of the slum lords didn't seem to be doing particularly well.  Without hard numbers to back it up, my speculation is that's due to the high vacancy and turnover in that model.
