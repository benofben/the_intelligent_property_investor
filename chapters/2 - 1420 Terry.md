"An investment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis, promises safety of principal and an adequate return. Operations not meeting these requirements are speculative." â€” Benjamin Graham, The Intelligent Investor

Clearly the basement air mattress was not a long term solution.  In early 2012, I'd been back in the US a bit over a year.  With no meaningful debts and a low cost of living relative to my income, I'd been able to start saving meaningfully for the first time in my life.  I was making the maximum contributions to my retirements accounts but didn't have a solid place to live and wasn't benefiting from the mortgage tax deduction.

Real estate can be an investment.  In the US we tend to buy real estate with mortgages.  Mortgages are subsidized by the government in various ways.  In the vast majority of circumstances it's rational to take advantage of mortgages and by extension these subsidies.

Debt can be divided into buckets of good debt and bad debt.  You could even divide it up a bit more to include really good debt or keep going until you have a continuum.  However, I find the buckets of good and bad a useful way to think about debt.  Which is which depends a lot on macroeconomic factors.  

If inflation is 3%, loans at anything less than that are probably quite appealing as they'll be inflated away.  Money borrowed at an interest rate less than inflation is free.  If the interest rate is greater than inflation, the loan may still be desirable, but considerably more thought ought to be put into whether it makes sense.  I view a good loan as anything with an interest rate less than, or at least close to, the rate of inflation.

![Inflation](/images/2/Inflation.png)

Over the last hundred years, inflation in the US has averaged about 3%.  You can argue the exact number a bit, depending on what basket of goods you consider.  Regardless, 3% is definitely a good estimate.  One takeaway is that if you aren't making at least a 3% return then you're losing value.

![10 Year](/images/2/10%20Year.png)

The risk free rate of return isn't a great way to beat inflation.  For this example, I'll use the 10 Year US Treasuries to define the risk free rate of return.  If you take the average since the Civil War, you get an annual return of 4.57%.  It's been much lower recently.

![Equities](/images/2/Equities.png)

Personally, I don't find the risk free rate of return a desirable personal benchmark.  I doubt you do either.  Equities tend to be where retail investors focus their attention.  The numbers vary depending on how you measure it, but the return over the last century typically comes in at about 10%.

If you're making over $100k/year, you really ought to be maxing out your retirement accounts.  As of 2018, you can contribute $5,500 to an IRA and $18,500 to a 401k.  Matching from your employer can increase that amount.  If you're over 55, catch up contributions increase it another $1,000 for the IRA and $6,000 for the 401k.  Additional vehicles like a SEP IRA can further increase your limits.  Making a Roth contribution instead of a traditional contribution will reduce your future tax liability as well.

![Equities](/images/2/IRA%20and%20401k.png)

If you begin making those maximum contributions at age 30, make the catch up contributions and retire at age 67, you'll likely be quite wealthy.  Personal finance books often estimate 4% as the amount you can take out of an account without depleting the principal.  If you do that, you'll have about $400k during your first year of retirement.  That amount will increase until you die.  If you make it to age 100 you'd have $60m in the bank and be able to take out over $2.2m tax free every year.  Of course it'd be 2088 in that example and your purchasing power would have diminished somewhat.  Nonetheless, it'd be a good situation to be in.

If any of the above sounds foreign, [The Bogleheads' Guide to Investing](https://www.amazon.com/Bogleheads-Guide-Investing-Taylor-Larimore/dp/0470067365) might be a good place to start.

If you're thinking of buying investment property, there are a number of preconditions I'd strongly encourage you to meet:

* Buy a primary residence first.  The mortgage interest deduction is free money, easily thousands of dollars.
* Pay off bad debt.  Credits cards and unsecured personal loans almost always fit the bill.  Some student loans do too, though subsidized Stafford loans often have very attractive rates that amount to free money.  It's unlikely any return you generate in the real estate market will be able to outrun credit card interest rates.
* Max out both your 401k and IRA contributions.  Index fund returns plus the tax advantage of a Roth account will be difficult to beat in the real estate market.

In short, you go to the real estate market once the options for easier money have exhausted themselves.  In 2012 I certainly wasn't in a position where buying investment property made sense, but I was in need of a primary residence.

I got another pre-qualification letter as the previous one was only good for Dallas.  Then I emailed Redfin again.  They'd changed the way they did things slightly.  Previously I'd been assigned a dedicated agent.  Now I was assigned a junior associate of some sort.  This person wasn't an agent.  I gave them a list of properties I wanted to look at.  They cancelled.  They rescheduled.  

Eventually one of the properties went pending.  I still remember it, a penthouse unit at [1101 Seneca](https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/1101-Seneca-St-APT-1801-Seattle-WA-98101/49002779_zpid/).  It had two bedrooms, was over a thousand square feet and they were asking $425k.  At the time the neighborhood, First Hill, was a little dreary.  It was dominated by hospital workers and lunch spots for them.  But, you could easily walk to Broadway and the Pike/Pine corridor on Capitol Hill.  The views were probably great too as it was the top floor of a mid-rise.  We drove by 1101, but the associate told me she couldn't show it because it was pending.  I later learned this was rubbish.  Most sellers are more than happy to take back up offers.  The associate was just being lazy.  It's another example of poorly aligned incentives.  Today, in 2017, Zillow estimates that condo as worth $700k.

After 1101 went pending, I wrote Redfin a nasty letter and was assigned a real agent, Chad.  He was quite professional.  We began to look at properties.  

One favorite was [2021 1st Ave](https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/2021-1st-Ave-APT-A8-Seattle-WA-98121/48951683_zpid/), a three level two bedroom overlooking Pike Place Market.  They were asking $750k, but I thought I could get it for a bit less.  I did the math and could make the DTI work with a 3.5% down payment, but just barely.  It was insane that the mortgage company would qualify me for a loan like that.  I spoke to Graham about renting out one of the bedrooms, but he was only will to pay $600/month.  I needed $1000 or so for it to make sense.  So, that was out.  That was 2012.  Today in 2017, Zillow currently estimates it at $1.14m.

Next up was [905 5th Ave](https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/909-5th-Ave-UNIT-1804-Seattle-WA-98164/83227147_zpid/), a modern condo overlooking the Rem Koolhaas designed Seattle Public Library.  It was a one bedroom and over 1000sqft.  The HOA fees were ridiculous, but it was so pretty.  The price per square foot was $528 at a time when comparable condos in Seattle were going for $300-$400.  I spent a week agonizing over it before calling up Chad and declaring the price per square foot untenable.  We decided a more tenable price was around $550k, but concluded that the seller would never go that low.  While those units have appreciated since, that unit was priced far over market.  Today in 2017, Zillow currently estimates it at $822k.

One day after spending time at Bauhaus, I stopped by an open house at [1420 Terry Ave](https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/1420-Terry-Ave-UNIT-1405-Seattle-WA-98101/60762418_zpid/).  The open house was run by Redfin.  Unit 1405 is really on the 13th floor.  It's in a building I'd fantasized about moving back to during my time in London, though I'd always looked at the two bedroom units online.  This was a one bedroom.  It'd also been trashed a bit.  The walls were painted obnoxious bright colors.  Better yet, it'd been done poorly, so bad drywall patching flashed through the red.  The carpeting was badly stained from wine and grime.  The owner, Michael, had moved back to Montreal.

![1420 - Red Wall](/images/2/1420%20-%20Red%20Wall.jpg)

Michael had also done an exceedingly strange job staging the place.  For instance, he'd stuck a couch in front of the built in gas fireplace.

![1420 - Couch](/images/2/1420%20-%20Couch.jpg)

The asking price was $339,950.  That put the price per sqft at $453, which was high for the time but not insanely so.  The building had been built in 2002 and used high quality finishes.  It had a doorman and a variety of amenities, even a rowing machine.  Best of all, it had a great view.  I could look out over Capitol Hill.  The sunrise would wake me a dawn.  It was a lovely condo.

Chad and I put together an offer.  It was a lowball based on comps for the square footage, while trying to avoid crossing psychological barriers as I had with the lowball offer in Dallas.  The number was $310k.

One thing I didn't properly consider at the time was how much Michael owed.  He'd had bought in 2005 for $355k.  If he'd bought with 20% down, then he'd have enough equity to take offers down to $355k*0.8=$284k way back in 2005.  Since then he'd have paid off a bit of the loan too.  

However, if he'd bought with 3.5% down, the numbers might be a bit different.  He would have owed $342,575 in 2005.  Assuming his loan had a 5% interest rate and was a 30 year fixed, he would have owed a bit over $301k by 2012.

Things could be even worse.  In 2005 loans with zero down payments were starting to become popular.  Additionally, interest only loans briefly became a thing.

Beyond that, Michael was going to have to pay the real estate agent commission.  That was 3% for my agent and refund plus whatever he'd negotiated with his agent.  Typically that was another 3%, but Redfin likely discounted it a bit.  Regardless, the fee could be quite substantial.  For example, $310k*6%=$18k

It was quite possible that accepting an offer of $310k would have required Michael to bring money to the table.  Put that together with likely minimal equity and I'd guess Michael's break even, despite having owned for 7 years was probably around $320k.

My offer for $310k was rejected.  Michael and his agent countered with $337k.  I signed it.  Given all the reasoning above, I suspect signing was the right thing to do, even in hindsight.  There's a saying in car dealerships that "a good deal is a state of mind."  I certainly have that state of mind, but I think it's rationally grounded in this case.

The loan I ended up with was very much a product of its time.  It's an FHA that predates the 2013 rule changes.  That means that once the equity from the "last known value" reaches 18%, I can request PMI be removed.  The "last known value" is an oddity.  With most loans you can get an appraisal and potentially have the PMI removed without a refinance.  Not with the FHA.  They use the original sale price to compute equity.  That means you have to wait 11 years to get sufficient equity.

With FHA loans originated after 2013, the PMI now stays with you for the lifetime on the loan.  Conventional mortgages don't have this restriction.  While the FHA allows a minimum downpayment of 3.5%, conventional loans with a 5% down payment are now pretty common.  You'd have to be either a bit crazy or desperate for that extra 1.5% of loan to get an FHA today.  The government has effectively ruined the program by making it non-competitive.

The down payment for 1420 Terry was the minimum of 3.5%.  The interest rate was also 3.5%.  The APR worked out to 4.295% because of the PMI and financed closing costs.  There's an oddity with PMI and APR that every lender will be sure to tell you of while simultaneously inflating its importance.  The APR calculation assumes that the PMI is present for the lifetime of the loan.  As mentioned above, in the pre-2013 FHA loans that's not the case.  So, the true APR of this loan is actually a bit better.  Lenders will go on at length about how unfair this is.

It's actually quite fair.  The government maintains standards for how the APR calculation must be done.  They also require that lenders disclose the APR.  This allows buyers to make apples to apples comparisons between loans.  Lenders hate that.

The 4.295% APR loan was a lot worse than I could have done.  What I should have done is gotten that quote and then shopped it around to whatever five lenders were offering the best APRs on Zillow.  Much like a new car, a mortgage is a commodity.  As long as it gets underwritten, you probably don't care how it happens.  What is important is the loan.  No matter what happens, you're going to be living with the loan until you pay it off.  It's unlikely you'll ever speak to that mortgage broker again after the loan closes.  Paying thousands (or tens of thousands) extra for the pleasure of their company just doesn't seem worth it.  Go with whatever is cheapest.

This is one of those do as I say, not as I do things.  I didn't know any of this at the time and just happily accepted the loan because it was the best thing I saw on Zillow.

During all this, I put together a rough model for understanding that purchase as an investment.  In the model I have appreciation set at 3%.  As discussed above, 3% is a reasonably approximation for the long term rate of inflation.  It then follows that 3% is also a reasonable approximation for the long term rate of appreciation for a property.  This fact is surprisingly controversial.

Let's suppose that isn't the case.  Specifically, let's suppose that you are in a market where the value of property grows faster than inflation.  One way that would be possible is for rents and mortgages to grow faster than inflation.  That's certainly possible for a time, and something we've seen in the Bay Area from 1990 to the present day.  In such a market it becomes more and more difficult to afford to live.  Housing ends up taking up an ever larger share of the economy and eats up economic gains elsewhere.

Herbert Stein puts it quite succinctly: "If something cannot go on forever, it will stop."  And stop it does.  

Seattle has been through a number of these corrections, recently in both 2001 and 2007.  There are other degenerate ways that housing prices can outpace inflation.  London, New York and Vancouver are all excellent examples of how foreign money seeking a store of value can cause growth in a market far beyond the rents that people who want to live in those properties are willing to pay.  This leads to empty neighborhoods and inevitably a correction.

![Mortgage Rates](/images/2/Mortgage%20Rates.png)

This model assumes a 30 year fixed rate mortgage.  One way that could change if I chose to refinance the loan.  That's unlikely given how low the 3.5% interest rate is.  To get an idea of just how low, let's take a look at mortgage rates over time.  Note that this data only goes back a few decades since 30 year fixed rate mortgages are a relatively recent innovation.  You can infer what the equivalent rate might have been from the 10 Year rates given previously.

Given that the 3.5% rate is a historical anomaly, I plan to hold onto it for the lifetime of the loan.  

This model doesn't capture any costs for rent, mortgage payment, taxes, PMI or HOA.  The assumption here is that rent balances out against the other costs.  As we'll see later that isn't exactly true, but it's a rough approximation.

![1420 - Equity and Return with 3% Appreciation](/images/2/1420%20-%20Equity%20and%20Return%20with%203%20Appreciation.png)

The ROE curve drops off quite quickly, starting at 116% and approaching 3%.  When the loan is originated, there's very little equity, so small absolute changes result in massive percentage changes.  This leads us to another surprisingly controversial fact in investing.  You should only be concerned with your personal rate of return.  How an asset fairs in absolute terms is inconsequential from a personal investment perspective.

Consider two companies:

* A - $100B in revenue with a PE of 10
* B - $100M in revenue with a PE of 10

Both companies have a rosy outlook and are expected to grow quite quickly.  All other things being equal, which company is more likely to be able to grow 10% in the coming year?  

In order for company A to grow 10%, it must increase revenues by $10B.  That's certainly possible, though it likely involves opening up an entirely new line of business larger than many stand alone businesses.  Alternatively, maybe some existing division might have an extraordinary year, but that would need to be combined with the majority of other divisions making their commitments.

Contrast that with company B.  To grow 10% it needs to increase revenues from $100m to $110m.  That's nothing to sneeze at either.  However, depending on the industry, a single contract might well make that growth target possible.

Company B is going to be able to grow more quickly and have a much easier time of it since the requirements in absolute dollars are so much smaller.  Given that, it is preferable as an investment.

Similarly, consider two companies:

* A - Share price of $10.  1 year price target of $11.
* B - Share price of $100.  1 year price target of $110.

Which one is better?  They're both expected to return 10% over the coming year.  The answer is neither.  Share price alone is an indicator of nearly nothing.  

Historically high share prices may have discouraged speculation a bit since stocks were purchased in lots of 100 shares.  That hasn't been the case for some time.  Except for extreme examples, like BRK.A, the price of an individual share is little barrier to speculation.

But, you came here to learn about real estate, not equities...  

In our model we have ROE dropping off as equity increases.  This is an unavoidable side effect of success.  Two factors, the appreciation of the property and the payoff of the loan combine to decrease leverage.  As leverage decreases, the ROE approaches the return of the underlying asset.

Eventually, in 2042, the loan is entirely paid off.  At that point there is no more leverage and the ROE tracks the return on the underlying perfectly.  

We can think of this condo when used as a primary residence as a structured financial instrument.  This instrument is relatively inexpensive to purchase.  The downpayment was $337,500*3.5%=$11,812.50.  That initial investment compounds at a variable rate that decreases over the time.

By adjusting the parameters of the model, we can understand it a bit better.  First, let's see what happens when we adjust the appreciation up to 10%.

![1420 - Equity and Return with 10% Appreciation](/images/2/1420%20-%20Equity%20and%20Return%20with%2010%20Appreciation.png)

We immediately notice that the initial ROE has jumped substantially.  This shouldn't be surprising as there is now a substantial difference between the 3.5% interest rate on the loan and the rate at which the value of the property is growing.  That leads us to an important point - A fixed rate mortgage is a bet that interest rates will increase.

Similarly, an adjustable mortgage is a bet that rates will go down.  That's a terrible bet in the current low interest rate environment.  But, it's a terrible bet for another reason as well.

A fixed rate mortgage allows you to make an asymmetric bet on future interest rates with protection against rate increases built in.  A variable rate mortgage offers no such protection.  If rates decrease in either case, you can refinance.  So, the protection against rate decreases that a variable mortgage provides given you little to nothing over a fixed rate.

Now let's see what happens when we adjust the appreciation down to 0%.

![1420 - Equity and Return with 0% Appreciation](/images/2/1420%20-%20Equity%20and%20Return%20with%200%20Appreciation.png)

The increase in value of our instrument is now entirely tied to the payoff of the mortgage.  One interesting change is that ROE now increases briefly before beginning its slide to 0.  Early on mortgage payments are almost entirely interest.  Late in a mortgage they are nearly entirely principal.  Those interest dominated payments in the first few months, causing the ROE to be quite low.  That effect shifts in 2014 as the portion of the payment going to principal increases.  In 2015 and onward, the ROE drops.  While the amount of each payment going toward principal is increasing at this point, that effect is not sufficient to offset the increasing equity.

When the mortgage is paid off in 2042, the return then drops to zero.  This is because we are no longer accumulating equity from mortgage payments and the property is not appreciating.

While this last model, might seem a bit degenerate, it's actually pretty close to have things play out over the long term when adjusting for inflation.  With the loan paid off, there's no principal accumulation to enhance returns.  Similarly, there's no opportunity for gain (or loss) on the difference between appreciation and the interest rate on the loan.

Studying the model above, and how it varies with appreciation, allows us to understand how a property functions as a structured financial instrument in a certain context.  It's not intended to be a complete framework, but allow us to build more accurate models while not overlooking fundamentals.  This model intentionally excludes a variety of significant variables.  Among those are rent, loan origination, fees and associated costs, taxes, PMI, the mortgage interest deduction and maintenance expenses.

So, let's revise the model to include new variables.

The mortgage interest deduction can have a significant impact.  Over the lifetime of the loan, I'll pay ($1475 * 360) - $337,500 * (100% - 3.5%) = $205,312.50 in interest.  Varying amounts of that interest could be deducted each year, with it weighted toward the front.  That's exactly what you'd want as it minimizes tax payments today at the expense of greater payments in the future.

We're going to continue to exclude the mortgage interest deduction.

In the new model, we introduce the PMI payment of $290.  This remains constant until it disappears when the equity requirements are met.  

The tax payment is computed from the number in year one with an adjustment that tracks the rate of appreciation/inflation.

Similarly, the HOA payment was $454 in year one.  That adjusts upward with the rate of appreciation.  

We're now going to include the real cost of the loan at origination.  That was 96.5% of the purchase price plus various fees that the lender allowed me to finance totaling roughly $3000.

Finally, we're going to introduce a rent payment that starts at $2000/month and adjusts upwards with inflation.

All other calculations follow from those assumptions.

![1420 - Model 2](/images/2/1420%20-%20Model%202.png)

The most striking thing about this model to me is how little an enhanced dose of realism impacted it.  There's a new feature of interest as well.  In 2023 the ROE spikes slightly.  That's due to the PMI dropping off.

One thing that isn't obvious here is the cash flow.  It's actually pretty dismal initially.  

![1420 - Cash Flow](/images/2/1420%20-%20Cash%20Flow.png)

In the first year, my cash flow was nearly -$10k.  It's not positive until 2024 when the combined effects of appreciation and the PMI are finally sufficient to outrun taxes and the every increasing HOA payment.  The cash flow jumps again in 2043 once the mortgage has been paid off.

To the naive observer this looks like a pretty shitty investment.  It requires a fair amount of money just to keep functioning.  And, that's not even counting all the maintenance effort plus administration costs of managing a rental property.

All that's true, but look back to the ROE.  Ultimately, it's all that matters.  Of course to get there you need to survive the ups and downs over the short term.  I've been fortunate to have a career that I can depend on to plug the gaps in cash flow over the short term.  Without that, this would have gone horribly wrong.

In this model, ROE once again trends toward a constant.  This time with a rent included, it trends to 6.8%.  That's actually a pretty decent return for any investment in the grand scheme of things.  It's inferior to the stock market, but exceeds our fixed income benchmark from earlier.  Of course this doesn't include operational expense.  And, income will be taxed as such, not at the long term capital gains rate.

Viewing this as an abstract financial instrument again, let's think a bit about what it provides.  Upfront it gives spectacular returns, but is pretty cash hungry.  Over time, it shifts the other way.  The returns drop, but the instrument starts spitting out cash.

If you buy one of these when you're 30 by the time you're retirement age it's producing a pretty decent income stream.  So, buying one of these things aligns pretty well with the typical trajectory of a life.

The instrument can also be sold.  There's a 6% fee for that plus you expose yourself to taxes on capital gains.  However, if you don't sell it, the principal continues to compound tax free.  If you want to get particularly nit picky about it, the principal actually compounds in a tax advantaged way if you take into account the black magic of depreciation schedules.

As usual, Warren Buffet has a relevant and pithy comment:

"Our favorite holding period is forever." - [1988 Berkshire Hathaway report](http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/1988.html)

Let's trying adjusting the model again.  This time we're going to bump appreciation from 3% up to 10% while keeping everything else the same.

![1420 - Model 2 with 10% Appreciation](/images/2/1420%20-%20Model%202%20with%2010%20Appreciation.png)

The first thing that probably pops out is the $16m number.  While that sounds really exciting, it's probably not.  The most realistic way I can see this scenario happening is for inflation to jump significantly.  

10% is certainly within the realm of possibility.  We've seen inflation rates that high as recently as 1981.  What we haven't seen is sustained inflation at that level in the US, though countries like Mexico and Vietnam provide excellent examples of how that is possible.  More degenerate examples like Zimbabwe show how it could really go wrong.  But, if things get that bad, you're probably worrying about fundamental issues rather than rejoicing about your profits from interest rate arbitrage.

In this scenario, the really interesting thing isn't the value in dollars.  Those are heavily inflated banana republic dollars.  The interesting part here is the ROE.  It starts out ridiculously high at 356% before setting at 16%.  In the previous model with 3% appreciation, ROE settled at 6.8%.  So, even with 10% appreciation, we're seeing a larger real return of approximately 6% per year even after accounting for what is likely to be inflation.

So, in addition to all the properties described above (increasing cash flow, decreasing ROE, etc.) our instrument is also a bet that inflation will increase.

That all sounds pretty peachy.  However, I like to be prepared for how things can go wrong.  One way would be a property crash.  We'll discuss the prospects for that in more detail later when drilling into the specifics of the Seattle market.  Another way for things to go horribly wrong is deflation.

For decades the Fed has had an avowed policy of working to avoid deflation.  They've done a pretty good job of it.  With rates close to zero for most of the last decade, we've had a couple close calls.  Before that, 1955 was the last time we saw deflation.

It's great to owe money in an inflationary environment.  The higher the inflation, the faster your debts become worthless.  Eventually a single, worthless, trillion dollar could pay off everything.  It's terrible to owe money in a deflationary environment.  In addition to the burden of compounding interest, the debt itself now grows.

![1420 - Deflation](/images/2/1420%20-%20Deflation.png)

Deflation causes our model to go a bit screwy.  ROE becomes meaningless because it's now computed on small or negative sums.  It's essentially 0 for the lifetime of the model as an equity is continuously wiped out. Heavy cash infusions are required to keep our instrument afloat.  There's not a lot to be gleaned from this.

![1420 - Deflation Cash Flow](/images/2/1420%20-%20Deflation%20Cash%20Flow.png)

Another terrifying part is the cash flow.  It's negative until the mortgage is paid off in 2042.  A sustained 40 year deflationary episode like this would be unprecedented in modern history, ever since the invention of fiat currency that Libertarians love to grumble about.  Most governments faced with something similar have just started madly printing money until the problem was fixed.

It would take something truly awful to incite the 40 year deflationary period, perhaps the collapse of the industrial economy as all our jobs are replaced by robots.  Alternatively, if we as a world society inexplicably decided to select a deflationary pseudo currency like Bitcoin as our reserve currency, that might do the trick.

Neither of those scenarios seem particularly likely.  Further, if that did come to pass there's one final escape hatch from this instrument.  Unlike securities margin calls where the brokerage can come knocking when you lose everything, mortgages are typically no recourse.  That means you can give the keys back to the mortgage company and walk away.  The difficult part would be identifying this scenario and choosing when to walk away.

Back to our narrative --- with the offer accepted, I got to go through the parts of the purchase I never had before.  Washington State has a standard purchase and sale agreement.  It includes a variety of contingencies including inspection, financing and even a neighborhood review.  With a mutual accepted offer in place, it's the job of the agents to shepherd their clients through these steps.

Since 1420 Terry is a condo, there was a period to review the HOA statements as well.  My friend Scott is a lawyer with expertise in real estate.  He reviewed the HOA statements, raised several minor issues as lawyers do when nothing insurmountable is at hand.  

The building, which is called the Meridian, is run very conservatively.  The board seems to be made up of retired lawyers, accountants and the like.  They appear to have too much time on their hands and are constantly dreaming up awful contingencies.  It makes for high HOA fees, but it seems unlikely there will be a special assessment.  All in all it's a great way to run an HOA.

At my request, Scott also gave a referral for an inspector, Paul.  Paul is way too passionate about being a building inspector.  He attends conferences on the subject.  He teaches courses in how to use an IR scanner to detect various issues.  He's also ridiculously thorough.  A typical inspection report from Paul will run to 30 pages including text, pictures and loads of footnotes about various issues that most people wouldn't consider mentioning.  In short, he's exactly what you want in an inspector.  He provides a comprehensive list of all the issues that allow you to make an informed decision on the next step.

Given that the condo was only a decade old the issues were pretty minor and had been obvious on the walk through.  Carpet needed replaced, paint was done poorly.  In addition, grout and caulk needed redone in some places.  The switch for the fireplace had failed.  Other than that most everything was good.

At the time, I was unaware of a game that every buyer should play with the inspection.  In Washington there's a Form 17 on which sellers are supposed to disclose any issues they're aware of.  Proving they were aware of something is incredibly difficult.  In addition, our courts have helpfully taken steps to neuter Form 17.  Nonetheless, if you find something nasty, you should provide the inspection to the seller.  They'll be obligated to disclose whatever nastiness you found to future buyers if your deal happens to fall through.  It gives them an incentive to be get the deal done with you.  That in turn gives you leverage to negotiate a bit.

I think my agent, Chad, just wanted the deal done.  He offered no ideas about the seller funding new carpeting or anything like that.  I probably left a few thousand dollars on the table there.

The condo closed without incident.  Paul was helpful enough to recommend a contractor who could assist with the repairs.  He recommended Mike, someone I depend on to this day.  At this point, the web of personal connections had stretched quite a bit.  Graham had introduced me to Scott at beers.  Scott introduced me to Paul and Paul introduced me to Mike.  Now Mike brought in his own network of subcontractors to do the work.

Instead of replacing the carpet, I opted for wood floors.  Mike informed me that the Meridian is constructed using post tensioned slabs of concrete.  Apparently, it's a technique that's quite good for withstanding earthquakes, but has some issues.  When the floor is set up, it has a number of wires going through it.  Concrete is poured and the wires are supposed to run through the middle of the slab.  They are tensioned with nuts on the end.  In many cases, like the Meridian, those nuts stick out the side of the building.

Mike told a horror story about another mid-rise built using this technique.  The nuts weren't properly sealed.  It rains a bit in Seattle.  The nuts rusted out.  At that point, the cables lost tension and the building went a bit wobbly.  It had to be condemned.  Apparently there were a number of lawsuits about that, and all because someone was careless about properly sealing things.

Mike had lots of horror stories.  I'd pulled down the disgusting blinds.  He warned me against screwing into the ceiling to install replacements.  Apparently the tension cables don't always end up in the middle on the slab.  If the cable isn't where it's supposed to be and you hit it with a drill, a variety of things will go wrong.  First off, you might end up up dead.  The cable can explode as it comes apart under tension.  Assuming you survive, you're going to find yourself in the unpleasant situation of explaining to the HOA why you mucked up the building.  In short, don't go drilling holes in post tensioned slabs.

This was all a bit educational, but it had a point.  First off, I couldn't have typical hardwood flooring installed, because using a nail gun on the slab was inadvisable at best.  The solution to that was pretty straightforward.  A floating wood floor would be installed.  It would have to use engineered wood.  That's a fancy way of saying composite.

The HOA at the Meridian also has extremely specific noise guidelines.  If the new floor didn't meet them, I would be required to have it removed.  Fortunately, there was sound proofing available with guarantees that exceeded what the HOA demanded.

Finally, post tensioned slabs end up sort of wavy given that they're both poured and tensioned.  The carpeting had covered that up pretty well.  The wood flooring wouldn't.  The solution was self leveling compound.  That seems to be a fancy name for very runny concrete.  It self levels, much as a glass of water is self leveling, and then dries, resolving the issue.

With a plan in place, all that was left was to pick the flooring.  I agonized over that decision.  At the time hand scraped flooring was really popular, particularly in very dark colors.  Happily I didn't go that route.  It would have dated very poorly.  Instead I ended up with a restaurant grade light wood flooring.  The restaurant grade bit meant it had a 25 year warranty.

In addition to installing the flooring, Mike and his guys repainted the place.  The poorly done bright colors were covered with white.  It made the space feel larger and more neutral.  The work took a few weeks.  Moving in was amazing.  Everything was perfect and clean.  It was like the Ashton, but it was mine, with no risk of rent spiraling out of control.

The sale closed on 4/25/12.  In early 2013 my job with TIBCO changed again.  My boss at the time offered me an opportunity as a sales guy in New York.  Graham needed a place to stay.  He moved into the bedroom.  I moved into a hotel in Williamsburg with an understanding I could inflate the air mattress whenever I needed in the living room of my now abandoned condo.  He paid a nominal shared living expense of $1000.

The HOA had a rental cap for the building.  I put the condo on the waiting list, assuming that I was going to stay in New York indefinitely.  Eventually Graham and I would move out.  I'd keep the place as a rental.

Time passed.  The condo came up off the waiting list.  At that point I had 60 days to rent it, or it would go back on the bottom of the list again.  I took some pretty terrible pictures and listed it on Craigslist and Zillow for $1998 on 10/28/13.  There were a ton of bites, so I figured I'd underpriced it.  On 11/5/13 I bumped the price up to $2098.  The bites mostly stopped.  

I panicked a bit.  If that 60 day period elapsed and I went back on the list, I was probably never going to come off it again.  That would mean I'd be stuck with an albatross of a condo while I lived in New York or be forced to sell it.  Neither was remotely appealing.

A friend of a friend, Aimee, was a professional property photographer.  Basically, she had a ton of wide angle and fish eye lenses that make rooms look big.  She also knew how to use them.  Further, she knew how to photoshop the results once complete.  I paid her several hundred dollars to take some photos and reposted my ads.  The leads began to trickle in again.

One guy nearly took the place for $2098.  He showed up in a Wharton hoody with his extremely well dressed girlfriend.  Inspecting the office nook, he declared it would be a good place to put a bar.  Out on the patio, he asked if a BBQ would be ok.  After I mentioned the HOA specifically forbade it, he pressed on, asking whether he could still BBQ.

He verbally agreed to take the place.  Scott had set me up with a fill in the blank lease, various disclosures and even the name of an agency, Tenant Verification Services, that could run credit and background checks.  I provided all that and never heard from the guy again.

Once again I panicked.  I dropped the rent back down to $1998 on 11/15/13.  The bites started coming in mass again.  By 11/21/13 I'd rented it to a couple.  It'd been about a month since I'd come off the rental waiting list and I was thrilled have succeeded.  Somewhat by accident I was now a landlord.

Today, in 2017, those same tenants are still in the condo.  The rent has adjusted upward slightly to $2100.  The HOA fees have gone up in the meantime as well.  The rent increases haven't keep pace with inflation.  But, the tenants pay on time and I don't really want to lose them.

Along the way, there have been a variety of minor repairs.  The garbage disposal went out.  Grout and caulk needed redone.  Most recently, the washer started making bad sounds.  It was the original one piece Maytag unit that the builder had installed in 2002.  Given that it was 15 years old, I just went ahead and bought a replacement.  It seemed easier than fighting with the aging unit.

With all this information, we can revise the model a bit more to include actual expenses and rents.

The numbers here are sobering.  In the first year a massive cash infusion was required.  That's followed by roughly $10k a year thereafter.  The eventual return of 5.8% isn't terrible, but it's not great either.  The first two years can be explained away a bit because the value I was getting from living there isn't factored into the model.  The subsequent years are more difficult to interpret in a positive way.

The cash flow situation is pretty horrific too.  Things finally go positive in 2035.

When I bought 1420 Terry, I was intending to make a bet that interest rates and inflation would go up.  I was very wrong.  In the intervening five years interest rates haven't gone much of anywhere.  Something else did happen though.  Seattle real estate blew up as the tech industry exploded a few blocks from that condo.

![1420 - Model 4](/images/2/1420%20-%20Model%204.png)

When we incorporate the real property values, a few interesting things happen.  As one would expect, cash flow in the model remains unchanged.  At some point, it will likely come in line with the higher real estate prices.  However, our model doesn't reflect that in any way.

In the new model, ROE from 2012 to 2017 improves significantly.  At the same time, the long term ROE actually gets worse.  This is because we now have more equity, which means less leverage.  That negatively impacts ROE over the long term.

On the surface these numbers all look pretty horrible.

To do:
* average ROE
* compute total change in cash
* model impact of rent changes
* discuss condo glut distorting market
