"An investment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis, promises safety of principal and an adequate return. Operations not meeting these requirements are speculative." â€” Benjamin Graham, The Intelligent Investor

Clearly the basement air mattress was not a long term solution.  It was early 2012 and I'd been back in the US a bit over a year.  With no meaningful debts and a low cost of living relative to my income, I'd been able to start saving meaningfully for the first time in my life.  I was making the maximum contributions to my retirements accounts but didn't have a solid place to live and wasn't benefiting from the mortgage tax deduction.

If you're thinking of buying investment property, there are a number of preconditions I'd strongly encourage you to meet:

* Buy a primary residence first.  The mortgage interest deduction is free money, easily thousands of dollars.
* Pay off bad debt, that is anything with punitive interest rates.  Credits cards and unsecured personal loans almost always fit the bill.  Some student loans do too, though subsidized Stafford loans often have very attractive rates that amount to free money.  It's unlikely any return you generate in the real estate market will be able to outrun credit card interest rates.
* Max out both your 401k and IRA contributions.  Index fund returns plus the tax advantage of a Roth account will be difficult to beat in the real estate market.

In short, you go to the real estate market once the options for easier money have exhausted themselves.  So, I certainly wasn't in a position where buying investment property made sense, but I was in need of a primary residence.

Debt can be divided into buckets of good debt and bad debt.  You could even divide it up a bit more to include really good debt.  Which is which depends a lot on macroeconomic factors.  If inflation is 10%, loans at anything less than that are probably quite appealing as they'll be inflated away.

Over the last hundred years, inflation in the US has averaged about 3%.  You can argue the exact number a bit, depending on what basket of goods you consider, but 3% is definitely a good estimate if nothing else.  One takeaway is that if you aren't making at least a 3% return then you're losing value.

The risk free rate of return over that same period typically comes in around 1%, depending on how exactly you measure it. (todo: add an example with treasuries)

Personally, I don't find the risk free rate of return a good personal benchmark.  A much more meaningful benchmark is the US equity market as a whole.  The numbers vary depending on how you measure it, but the return over the last century typically comes in at about 10%.
