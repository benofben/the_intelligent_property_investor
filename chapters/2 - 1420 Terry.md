"An investment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis, promises safety of principal and an adequate return. Operations not meeting these requirements are speculative." â€” Benjamin Graham, The Intelligent Investor

Clearly the basement air mattress was not a long term solution.  It was early 2012 and I'd been back in the US a bit over a year.  With no meaningful debts and a low cost of living relative to my income, I'd been able to start saving meaningfully for the first time in my life.  I was making the maximum contributions to my retirements accounts but didn't have a solid place to live and wasn't benefiting from the mortgage tax deduction.

Real estate can be an investment.  In the US we tend to buy real estate with mortgages.  Mortgages are subsidized by the government in various ways.  In the vast majority of circumstances it's rational to take advantage of mortgages and by extension these subsidies.

Debt can be divided into buckets of good debt and bad debt.  You could even divide it up a bit more to include really good debt or keep going until you have a continuum.  However, I find the buckets of good and bad a useful way to think about debt.  Which is which depends a lot on macroeconomic factors.  

If inflation is 3%, loans at anything less than that are probably quite appealing as they'll be inflated away.  Money borrowed at an interest rate less than inflation is free.  If the interest rate is greater than inflation, the loan may still be desirable, but considerably more thought ought to be put into whether it makes sense.  I view a good loan as anything with an interest rate less than, or at least close to, the rate of inflation.

Over the last hundred years, inflation in the US has averaged about 3%.  You can argue the exact number a bit, depending on what basket of goods you consider.  Regardless, 3% is definitely a good estimate.  One takeaway is that if you aren't making at least a 3% return then you're losing value.

The risk free rate of return isn't a great way to beat inflation.  For this example, I'll use the 10 Year US Treasuries to define the risk free rate of return.  If you take the average since the Civil War, you get an annual return of 4.57%.  It's been much lower recently.

Personally, I don't find the risk free rate of return a desirable personal benchmark.  I doubt you do either.  Equities tend to be where retail investors focus their attention.  The numbers vary depending on how you measure it, but the return over the last century typically comes in at about 10%.

If you're making over $100k/year, you really ought to be maxing out your retirement accounts.  As of 2018, you can contribute $5,500 to an IRA and $18,500 to a 401k.  Matching from your employer can increase that amount.  If you're over 55, catch up contributions increase if another $1,000 for the IRA and $6,000 for the 401k.  Additional vehicles like a SEP IRA can further increase your limits.  Making a Roth contribution instead of a traditional contribution will reduce your future tax liability as well.

If you begin making those maximum contributions at age 30, make the catch up contributions and retire at age 67, you'll likely be quite wealthy.  Personal finance books often estimate 4% as the amount you can take out of an account without depleting the principal.  If you do that, you'll have about $400k during your first year of retirement.  That amount will increase until you die.  If you make it to age 100 you'd have $60m in the bank and be able to take out over $2.2m tax free every year.  Of course it'd be 2088 in that example and your purchasing power would have diminished somewhat.  Nonetheless, it'd be a good situation to be in.

If any of the above sounds foreign, [The Bogleheads' Guide to Investing](https://www.amazon.com/Bogleheads-Guide-Investing-Taylor-Larimore/dp/0470067365) might be a good place to start.

If you're thinking of buying investment property, there are a number of preconditions I'd strongly encourage you to meet:

* Buy a primary residence first.  The mortgage interest deduction is free money, easily thousands of dollars.
* Pay off bad debt.  Credits cards and unsecured personal loans almost always fit the bill.  Some student loans do too, though subsidized Stafford loans often have very attractive rates that amount to free money.  It's unlikely any return you generate in the real estate market will be able to outrun credit card interest rates.
* Max out both your 401k and IRA contributions.  Index fund returns plus the tax advantage of a Roth account will be difficult to beat in the real estate market.

In short, you go to the real estate market once the options for easier money have exhausted themselves.  In 2012 I certainly wasn't in a position where buying investment property made sense, but I was in need of a primary residence.

I got another pre-qualification letter as the previous one was only good for Dallas.  Then I emailed Redfin again.  They'd changed the way they did things slightly.  Previously I'd been assigned a dedicated agent.  Now I was assigned a junior associate of some sort.  This person wasn't an agent.  I gave them a list of properties I wanted to look at.  They cancelled.  They rescheduled.  

Eventually one of the properties went pending.  I still remember it, a penthouse unit at [1101 Seneca](https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/1101-Seneca-St-APT-1801-Seattle-WA-98101/49002779_zpid/).  It had two bedrooms, was over a thousand square feet and they were asking $425k.  At the time the neighborhood, First Hill, was a little dreary.  It was dominated by hospital workers and lunch spots for them.  But, you could easily walk to Broadway and the Pike/Pine corridor on Capitol Hill.  The views were probably great too as it was the top floor of a mid-rise.  We drove by 1101, but the associate told me she couldn't show it because it was pending.  I later learned this was rubbish.  Most sellers are more than happy to take back up offers.  The associate was just being lazy.  It's another example of poorly aligned incentives.  Today, in 2017, Zillow estimates that condo as worth $700k.

After 1101 went pending, I wrote Redfin a nasty letter and was assigned a real agent, Chad.  He was quite professional.  We began to look at properties.  

One favorite was [2021 1st Ave](https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/2021-1st-Ave-APT-A8-Seattle-WA-98121/48951683_zpid/), a three level two bedroom overlooking Pike Place Market.  They were asking $750k, but I thought I could get it for a bit less.  I did the math and could make the DTI work with a 3.5% down payment, but just barely.  It was insane that the mortgage company would qualify me for a loan like that.  I spoke to Graham about renting out one of the bedrooms, but he was only will to pay $600/month.  I needed $1000 or so for it to make sense.  So, that was out.  That was 2012.  Today in 2017, Zillow currently estimates it at $1.14m.

Next up was [905 5th Ave](https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/909-5th-Ave-UNIT-1804-Seattle-WA-98164/83227147_zpid/), a modern condo overlooking the Rem Koolhaas designed Seattle Public Library.  It was a one bedroom and over 1000sqft.  The HOA fees were ridiculous, but it was so pretty.  The price per square foot was $528 at a time when comparable condos in Seattle were going for $300-$400.  I spent a week agonizing over it before calling up Chad and declaring the price per square foot untenable.  We decided a more tenable price was around $550k, but concluded that the seller would never go that low.  While those units have appreciated since, that unit was priced far over market.  Today in 2017, Zillow currently estimates it at $822k.

One day after spending time at Bauhaus, I stopped by an open house at [1420 Terry Ave](https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/1420-Terry-Ave-UNIT-1405-Seattle-WA-98101/60762418_zpid/).  The open house was run by Redfin.  Unit 1405 is really on the 13th floor.  It's in a building I'd fantasized about moving back to during my time in London, though I'd always looked at the two bedroom units online.  This was a one bedroom.  It'd also been trashed a bit.  The walls were painted obnoxious bright colors.  Better yet, it'd been done poorly, so bad drywall patching flashed through the red.  The carpeting was badly stained from wine and grime.  The previous owner had moved back to Montreal.

The asking price was $337K.  That put the price per sqft at $449, which was high for the time but not insanely so.  The building had been built in 2002 and used high quality finishes.  It had a doorman and a variety of amenities, even a rowing machine.  Best of all, it had a great view.  I could look out over Capitol Hill.  The sunrise would wake me a dawn.  It was a lovely condo.

Chad and I put together an offer for asking.  In retrospect, I probably could have gotten it cheaper.  The offer was quickly accepted.  Given that both the listing and buyer's agents worked in the same Redfin office in Seattle, that's not terribly surprising.
