> Life would be perfect if I lived in that house. -Meghan Daum

I'd moved down to Tacoma to get away from Seattle a reinvent myself a bit.  It also reminded me of how Seattle was when I first lived there.  While living in the townhouse, I made up with my longtime on and off girlfriend.  Things had been up and down since I met her in Atlanta.  I was on a business trip and living in Dallas at the time.

In early 2017, we decided to buy a house and try being a bit more serious.  The plan was to play house for a year and then buy a more serious house if all went well.

Chris took us to see over 70 houses.  In the time since I'd bought the townhouse, the market had changed significantly.  In 2015 it'd been possible to by a reasonable house around 6th Ave for $300k. $400k would get a nice one.  By 2017, the prices had moved up to $400k-$600k.  Houses were sold within days of going on market, often with multiple offers.

I initially assumed the buyers were from Seattle, dislocated because of price like me.  That was true in a handful of cases.  I overheard one woman from Seattle at an open house asking if the neighborhood around was safe.  She was smack in the middle of North End, across from a good school.  It couldn't have been safer.

Most of the buyers seemed to be Tacoma area locals, wanting to buy their first house.  Almost everyone we saw was a young couple, 25-35.  It wasn't just first time buyers either.  While contemplating the impossibility of fitting furniture in extremely small living room of house, a woman announced to me that she was a property investor.  From there, without introduction, she then went on to explain various touchy feely things about houses speaking to you and such.  Her whole spiel was about as far from principled investing as I could imagine.  However, I think it speaks for the state of the market in 2017 that she was there.

When a correction comes, I suspect it will impact far out areas like Tacoma most.  Seattle has grown to such a degree that any downward pressure on housing prices is likely going to be met with an influx of eager buyers from further out.  The economy would have to get pretty rough for that to be untrue.

After 5 or 10 failed offers, we eventually got mutual acceptance on a house at 1414 N Oakes, amusingly only 8 blocks from the townhouse.  After the 1122 24th Ave experience I'd promised myself never to buy another flipped house.  This was a flipped house.

The original owner, Jane, had bought it in 1989 for $51,900.  She'd gotten divorced, raised a son and eventually sold it to a flipper in 2015 for $210,100.  The annual rate of return on that works out to 4.38%.  During that time the neighborhood had changed massively for the better, with the moniker "Tacompton" becoming less relevant.  Jane seemed to have good intentions.  There was evidence of many half started projects - siding painted one color here and some molding partially painted another color there.  However, the house needed serious work when it was sold.

The flippers were from the Milgard family, whose business is windows.  They left the original windows, which were actually pretty charming.  The put in a new kitchen and two bathrooms, all of which were reasonable.  They also did work to upgrade the plumbing and electrical.  That's rare from what I've seen in flipped houses.  They seemed to just run out of money.  The original kitchen plans called for a Viking.  The house had a mid range GE and no fridge.  Additionally there was a substantial amount of construction debris outside.  This was probably a good thing as it likely discouraged other bidders.

The porch was also coming off the house.  This was fixed by the seller before closing, but I really would have preferred money to fix it myself.  The work a seller does tends to be good enough, whereas if you're going to have to live with it for some time, you put some effort in.

The house was originally listed at $429,950.  The price dropped to $414,950 and we got it for $407,500.

The loan was 5% down with a 4% interest rate.  The APR came to 4.506%, which was high.  A large portion of that was due to the PMI.

The model looks pretty ugly this time around.  It assumes a rent of $2200 for 2018.  That seems reasonable, given the $1900 rent at 616, but it's hard to tell.

The real return is pretty terrible.  Total expenses were $46,788.90 for 2017.  Equity from the sales price is $20,375.  The picture is slightly better the Zillow estimate for the end of 2017 is used.  That puts the value of the house at $425,796.  Similarly the loan value was $381,576.  That gives equity of $44,240.  This means 2017 was approximately break even.  Maintaining equity against the costs of buying a house isn't bad.  A positive return would have been preferable of course.

![1414 - Cash Flow](/images/6/1414%20-%20Cash%20Flow.png)

The cash flow comes out well.  This is, once again a product of a relatively low interest rate, purchase price and reasonable rents relative to those.

Paul uncovered his usually litany of items, including a degrading chimney.  Ryan fixed that up and did various other cleanup work.  In addition to that, there was an enormous amount of sweat equity picking garbage out of the yard and redoing the landscaping.

Now let's assume something new.  What if, instead of renting the house out, it's lived in for the few decades?  No rent will be collected.  We could, of course, put some figure in for rent a compute a return off that, pretending to be our own landlord as in chapter 2.  However, we're going to ignore that benefit and consider the house purely as an investment.

It's not great.  Returns eventually wind up at 1.86%.  The highest projected return is 3.46% in 2026, when the PMI comes off. Basically, the house loses money, not quite keeping up with the rate of inflation.

However, when viewed back in the context of a space to live, that isn't terrible.  The model can be interpreted as saying that you pay $46k up front plus rent and tie that money up for decades for a slightly negative return in exchange for a place to live indefinitely.  

You can eventually recover the majority of that value when you sell.  Along the way you will recieve tax benefits, though at sale you will pay significant transaction costs.

Let's consider Benjamin Graham's definition of an investment again:

> An investment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis, promises safety of principal and an adequate return. Operations not meeting these requirements are speculative. â€” Benjamin Graham, The Intelligent Investor

The house, when considered this way is not an investment.  It has a near guarantee to slowly eradicate principal with a slightly negative return.  It's only speculative if you believe that property values can outpace inflation over decades.  It's neither an investment nor a speculation.  It's a home.

![1414 - Cash Flow Primary](/images/6/1414%20-%20Cash%20Flow%20Primary.png)

As one would expect, the cash flow is always negative.  It periodically improves as the PMI or loan is paid off and then worsens as inflation increases the tax bill.
