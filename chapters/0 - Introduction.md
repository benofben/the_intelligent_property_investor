# Introduction

My favorite business books are written by someone who did well and wants to share insights on their life. Some of my favorite examples are:

* [Berkshire Hathaway Letters to Shareholders](https://www.amazon.com/Berkshire-Hathaway-Letters-Shareholders-Buffett/dp/0615975070)
* Conrad Hilton's [Be My Guest](https://www.amazon.com/Be-My-Guest-Conrad-Hilton/dp/0130715980)
* Ross Perot's [My Life & The Principles for Success](https://www.amazon.com/Life-Principles-Success-Ross-Perot/dp/1565302370)
* T Boone Picken's [The First Billion is the Hardest](https://www.amazon.com/First-Billion-Hardest-Reflections-Comebacks/dp/0307396010)

I learn through stories.  I really like the stories about how these people succeeded early in life.  They're a lot more relevant to where I am than the later in life stories of struggling to run a philanthropic organization with 100s of millions in personal funding, something the later chapters in these books are often filled with.

I would encourage you to carefully evaluate both the motives and credentials of anyone you take advice from.  If you find either wanting, that advice should be examined incredibly cautiously.  I find it useful when I can understand another person's motivations.  Then I can evaluate how they fit with mine and adjust for any incompatibilities.

My motives for writing this are:

* I enjoy sharing ideas and writing.  Additionally, writing helps me clarify my thinking.  I think writing this book will help me clarify my ideas about real estate investing and ensure I'm not making any avoidable missteps.
* I want to try self publishing on Amazon.  I'm curious if a book like this would make money.  I don't expect to be pleasantly surprised, but am open to the possibility.
* My favorite part of business memoirs is the start where someone creates a new business from nothing.  The first million seems like the hardest.  With that in place compounding interest takes over and things get simpler.  I'd like to see more stories about the start.  Maybe telling mine will prompt others to tell theirs.

I hope you enjoy the book.
