# Selling

Selling real estate is a wonderful way to incur substantial transaction costs.  In Washington, the seller typically pays a 6% commission on the sale price of the property.  In addition, there is a 4% transfer tax in Washington that is typically paid by the seller.  Various other fees present themselves, plus there is inevitable vacancy as the property changes hands.

Let's consider just the 6% commission though.  First let's consider the 3% appreciation scenario.  This is for a loan of $100k.

If sold before year 3, the property result in a loss.  And this will be a loss assuming you were able to cover all the cash flow with rent.  That assumption isn't entirely safe from what we've seen earlier.

Of course, things can always be worse.  If the property doesn't appreciate, break even on the 6% commission doesn't happen until year 5.

This model shows pretty dismal returns for selling early on.  The real world returns would be far worse.  For any of the properties we've studied in detail, a sale within the first few years would have resulted in a devastating loss.

The takeaway here is simple - if you're buying a property, you probably ought to buy for decades.  Anything less is likely to lead to ruinous transaction costs that will rob you of return.
