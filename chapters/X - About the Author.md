Ben Lackey is a raging ego maniac who enjoys long walks on the beach.  He's a little shocked that he's summoned the hubris to publish this and is deeply thankful you've made it all the way to the end.  While he spends a lot of time fiddling with properties, his day job is in technology.  He lives in Seattle with two Siamese kittens, Ahi and Mahi.
