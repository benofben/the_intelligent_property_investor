# The Summing Up

> In the long run we are all dead. -John Maynard Keynes, A Tract on Monetary Reform

The naive way to put this all together leads to some pleasant looking numbers, but is horribly misleading.

In 70 years the total value of these properties will be nearly $16m, assuming a 3% annual growth.  Of course, that's a long enough run that Keynes's comment above becomes relevant.

![Value - 10 Year](/images/7/Value%20-%2010%20Year.png)

Considering 10 years instead is somewhat interesting.  In that, we can see some over the struggles described in early chapters.  Unsurprisingly, 1122 24th ends up as the biggest single chunk given it's greater worth relative to the others.

For many investments, it's interesting to look at the past history.  That's difficult here for a variety of reasons.  The Seattle area has changed massively since 2000 with entire new industries coming to the city.  That means the rents and character of the market has changed as well.  Similarly, the properties have changed.  The condos had significant work done to them.  The townhouse didn't event exist prior to 2010.  The two houses were in extremely poor shape.  Comparing 1122 24th Ave in 2000 and 2020 would require somehow accounting for $200k+ of remodel work that went into it.

In short, looking backward in real estate is difficult.  It'd be simpler in a more static market with more static houses, perhaps a quiet town in rural Germany would fit the bill.

![Equity - 10 Year](/images/7/Equity%20-%2010%20Year.png)

Over 70 years the equity graph is basically the same as the value graph.  With the mortgages paid off, the values are the same.  Over ten years, we see some interesting characteristics of equity.  The condos have very little equity in 2012, 2013 and 2014.  In 2015, the Seattle property market begins to take off.  Suddenly equity starts growing very quickly.  That levels off as we move from the real returns to projected returns of 2018 and onward.

None of this is really a particularly useful way of thinking of the five properties as a unified portfolio though.  Two key components are missing from this analysis.  First, the capital required to generate this equity isn't reflected in any meaningful way.  Second, there is no consideration for cash flow.

We could look at cumulative cash flow.  However, one characteristic of these investments is that they absorb a significant amount of cash up front.  In the good cases, that is reflected in equity, in the bad cases, it's destroyed.  Either way it has minimal impact on cash flow, so that measurement wouldn't be particularly meaningful.

All this starts to point to an interesting realization.  These properties, when taken together with their mortgages and rental incomes are more valuable than their equity or cash flow alone would imply.  When we view that bundle as a financial instrument with some inputs, outputs and value this becomes more clear.  This leads us back to the metrics we identified previously.  The most important of this is likely ROE.

So, let's take a look at ROE in aggregate for the five properties.  

Since starting buying property in 2012, total cash flow has been -$510,447.39.  Total equity is now 908,347.03.  That gives a return of 78%.  This is a rough estimate that doesn't properly account for the time value of money during that period.  When annualized that return is 10%.

Once again, that 10% figure is a little discouraging given that it is available in the stock market for considerably less effort, however there were a variety of benefits along the way.  These included housing for much of that period, tax benefits and the ability to change housing options without paying transaction costs.

Now, let's consider three different rates of appreciation: 3%, 5% and 10%.  That should give us a view into the range of probably outcomes over the next decade.
