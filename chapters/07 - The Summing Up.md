# The Summing Up

> In the long run we are all dead. -John Maynard Keynes, A Tract on Monetary Reform

The naive way to put this all together leads to some pleasant looking numbers, but is horribly misleading.

In 70 years the total value of these properties will be nearly $16m, assuming a 3% annual growth.  Of course, that's a long enough run that Keynes's comment above becomes relevant.

Considering 10 years instead is somewhat interesting.  In that, we can see some over the struggles described in early chapters.  Unsurprisingly, 1122 24th ends up as the biggest single chunk given it's greater worth relative to the others.

![Equity - 10 Year](/images/7/Equity%20-%2010%20Year.png)

Over 70 years the equity graph is basically the same as the value graph.  With the mortgages paid off, the values are the same.  Over ten years, we see some interesting characteristics of equity.  The condos have very little equity in 2012, 2013 and 2014.  In 2015, the Seattle property market begins to take off.  Suddenly equity starts growing very quickly.  That levels off as we move from the real returns to projected returns of 2018 and onward.

None of this is really a particularly useful way of thinking of the five properties as a unified portfolio though.  Two key components are missing from this analysis.  First, the capital required to generate this equity isn't reflected in any meaningful way.  Second, there is no consideration for cash flow.

All this starts to point to an interesting realization.  These properties, when taken together with their mortgages and rental incomes are more valuable than their equity would imply.  When we view that bundle as a financial instrument with some inputs, outputs and value, it becomes clear these are worth a bit more than the value alone would imply.
