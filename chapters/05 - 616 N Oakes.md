# 616 N Oakes

> He scoured the suburbs of Paris and eventually discovered a villa for sale on the hillside above Fontenay-aux-Roses, standing in a lonely spot close to the Fort and far from all neighbours.  This was the answer to his dreams, for in this district which had so far remained unspoilt by rampaging Parisians, he would be safe from molestation: the wretched state of communications, barely maintained by a comical railway at the far end of the town and a few little trams which came and went as they pleased, reassured him on this point.  Thinking of the new existence he was going to fashion for himself, he felt a glow of pleasure at the idea that here it would be too far out for the tidal wave of Parisian life to reach him, and yet near enough for the proximity of the capital to strengthen him in his solitude.  For, since a man has only to know he cannot get to a certain spot to be seized with a desire to go there, by not entirely barring the way back he was guarding against any hankering after human society, any nostalgic regrets. -Joris-Karl Huysmans, Against Nature

To most Seattleites, Tacoma is merely the "tac" in Seatac, or perhaps, that place where the traffic gets all mucked up while driving between Seattle and Portland.  Surprisingly, it's a city in it own right as well.  At the beginning of the 20th century Seattle, Tacoma and Olympia were all vying to be the dominant city on Puget Sound.  Seattle won.  Olympia got the consolation prize of being the state capitol.  Tacoma lost.

The city is filled with relics from better days.  The downtown has a variety of grand old crumbling structures, including an abandoned Elks lodge that McMenamins is refurbishing.  The Rust mansion is appropriately named both for the man who constructed it and its current state.  In 2017, the downtown still had a vacant Countrywide office that looked as if it could have closed yesterday.  Countrywide imploded in 2007.

With rents in Seattle increasing, low wage workers have fled the city.  A decade ago they fled north, building up areas like Shoreline and Everett.  Today even Bothell is a relatively affluent suburb.  More recently the development has started in the south as well.  One of the most visible examples of that is Point Ruston, a mixed use development along Puget Sound in Tacoma that was built on a Superfund site.  As of 2017, a 3 bedroom penthouse condo is available there for the bargain price of $1m.

The Port of Tacoma is a major employer.  As the Port of Seattle increasingly turns down business for environmental reasons, there seems to be opportunity for the ports further south.  There's also a paper mill, responsible for the "Tacoma Aroma," one of many stigmas associated with the city.  To the south, Joint Base Louis McCord (JBLM) employs tens of thousands.

Tacoma has lost many of its major businesses.  Weyerhaeuser, originally founded in Tacoma moved their headquarters to nearby Federal Way in the 1970s.  In 2016 they shuttered that office and moved to downtown Seattle.  Similarly, Russel Investments was headquartered in downtown Tacoma until 2010.  They moved into the building that briefly served as Washington Mutual's headquarters before they imploded in the credit crunch.

Bizarrely, there's an increasing amount of NIMBY-ism in Tacoma.  The population at large seems to believe the local economy is far more robust than it is.  In 2016 the question of whether to open a methanol plant in the industrial area by the port was voted down as a ballot measure.  That might be fine if there were other employers in place, but there aren't.  Every morning I-5 northbound is packed with panel trucks and pickup trucks as laborers head to Seattle for the day.

Tacoma has an inordinate number of coffee shops, breweries and weird little shops that could only exist in the Pacific Northwest.  The rents are low enough that strange and marginal business can survive.  In 2016, 6th Ave was a great example of that.  6th is a five block long strip of bars, coffeeshops and oddities.  At the time my favorites along there included a pizza place called Half Pint.  Next door was Sluggo Brewing, equal parts used bike shop, brewery, bar and arcade.  Down the street Bluebeard Coffee, Ice Cream Social, Masa for Mexican food, a crystal and incense shop, and game shop rounded out the neighborhood a bit.

6th Ave in 2015 reminded me a lot of Broadway in Seattle circa 2000.  It had a good mix of shops and the rents were low enough that it had a good mix of characters too.  It's rare to see aspiring novelists hanging out in coffeeshops in cities where the rent requires a six figure income.

Chris and I kicked off a house search in Tacoma in August, 2015.  The market was very similar to the CD two years earlier.  The area around 6th had numerous Craftsman houses that had been poorly maintained and remodeled strangely.  South of sixth the houses were smaller and in extremely poor shape.  Many had serious structural problems.  A significant number were tear downs.

One tragedy in this is that, in many cases, the owners has clearly done substantial work to the houses.  In other cases, it was flippers who did the work.  In either case, it was lipstick on a pig.  One house had a Viking Range and marble countertops with a strange little bar.  It also had poorly installed windows with a second set of windows installed over them.  Money had been spent on the wrong things.

Work that owners had done to these houses tended to be extravagant in one particular area and then non-existent in others.  To contrast, houses that were being flipping all got a very similar HGTV treatment.  Cheap and dark laminate wood floors were common in these houses.  In many cases they weren't flat.  Kitchens had been redone with inexpensive cabinets and fake stone countertops.  If exterior work had been done, it'd be in the form of a coverup, a quick sprayed paint job or vinyl siding were two favorites.

I settled on a townhouse at 616 N Oakes.  The lot had previously had a Craftsman that rotted to oblivion.  Then it languished as a vacant grass lot for a few years.  The lot was developed in 2010 by Darian.  She'd built four townhouses and sold three of them off.  The fourth she sold to herself and kept as a rental unit.  The LLC that did all this promptly went out of business.

Unsurprisingly, the work was substandard.  It appeared to have started off with the best of intentions and then deteriorated.  The townhouses were two stories with a roof deck.  This meant flat roofs.  All four roofs leaked.  [616 N Oakes, Unit B](https://www.redfin.com/WA/Tacoma/616-N-Oakes-St-98406/unit-B/home/40493403), the unit I offered on, had a new roof.  Unfortunately, 616 N Oakes Unit A, which it shared a wall with, did not.

The owner of that unit, Vanessa, had bought from Darian for $210k in 2012.  Vanessa eventually sold in 2017 for $220k.  During that period she completely neglected maintenance and left the townhouse vacant for over a year while living in Olympia.  She'd periodically announce plans to rent it or advertise it on Airbnb as an "Executive Rental."  I may have expressed skepticism about the demand for short term executive rentals in Tacoma.

The first time I met Vanessa, she announced she worked in real estate.  I asked what she did and she elaborated that she had properties.  Excited to find a fellow investor, I asked her for details.  She proudly said that this was her first property.  Vanessa and the alarming number of others like her around Tacoma made it seem quite likely they was a bit of a bubble developing in Tacoma during that period.

Vanessa would periodically stop by the townhouse to fix it up.  She might futz with the garden or hire a handyman to paint something.  At one point she installed a rustic garden gate out of character with the rest of the complex.  If there'd been a HOA, they would have ordered it removed.

The work that needed to happen never occurred.  Superficially Vanessa made $10k on that townhouse.  Of course, that was over a period of 5 years, during a rising market.  She also paid the mortgage for that time and presumably a 6% agent commission of $13.2k.  

Behind Vanessa, was 614 N Oakes, Unit A.  That had been bought from Darian in 2013 for $185k.  Duncan had the roof replaced and then proceeded to embark upon a legal battle with Darian to reclaim his damages.  I understand he eventually got a judgement, though I think there's a blood from a turnip issue with that.

Finally, 614 N Oakes, Unit B was still owned by Darian.  Tomassi, an affable immigrant from Fiji, lived there.  I'll be forever thankful to him for introducing me to TAGRO.  For a time, he was surprisingly willing to put up with the leaky roof.  Eventually his patience waned and he moved elsewhere.

All four units had radiant heat.  A domestic hot water heater acted both in its intended role and to heat water that was pumped through the floor.  One of the pumps had failed, an issue Paul identified with his IR scanner, and the seller fixed.  Upstairs, water was piped through two fan units.  The fans would blow across the hot pipes to produce heated air.  At least that was the theory.  It was difficult to achieve the delicate balance where upstairs was getting water at 110 or 120 while downstairs was well under 100.  Apparently if the water coursing through the floor got hot enough the foundation would crack.

Radiant heat might be a passable supplemental way to heat your bathroom floor in a luxury condo.  It's a stupid way to heat an entire house.  Forced air is simpler and better.  If you get the duct work right, the only thing that will ever need replacing is the furnace itself.  Those typically last 20 years or more.

One ticking time bomb was the boiler itself.  It was installed during a brief period where the vendor condoned the dual use domestic water supply and heating idea.  They since decided that wasn't a good idea.  Some units do support that, but they're hideously expensive.  At some point, that boiler is going to die.  Then there'll be a decision, try to replace it with something built for purpose, or rip the whole thing out and put in a new heating system.  I'm inclined toward option two.  Some simple electric wall units or even baseboard heaters might be a more economical solution than trying to make the radiant heat go.

Jessica, the owner of the unit for sale, had done minor upkeep, but cut corners.  She'd originally purchased in 2012 for $219,950.  It was pretty clear she was cash strapped.  Judging from the sales records, her parents had helped her with the purchase.  She'd then worked as a bartender before having a kid and moving back in with them.

Vanessa had initially asked $259,000 and then dropped to $237,500.  We wrote an offer for asking with 5% down that was promptly accepted.  Paul uncovered a handful of issues, including the heat.  That was partially resolved with the installation of a new pump before closing.

![616 - Roof](/images/5/616%20-%20Roof.jpg)

I moved in during December.  As it was raining throughout the winter, I kept noticing leaks by the doors.  I called up the Roofer, Preferred Roofing Services.  Eventually I got transferred to Ed.  It was a family business and Ed took pride in his work.  Surprised that the roof would be leaking, he came out to take a look.  He did that under warranty, even though I wasn't the original buyer.  

At Ed's suggestion we ran the garden hose up to the roof and began spraying the doors.  I was pretty skeptical this was the issue, but he was insistent.  Apparently he'd redone the entire roof, but Jessica's dad had insisted on reinstalling the doors and paneling himself.  Eventually Ed convinced me.  He referred me over to Ryan at South Sound Construction to replace both doors.  The leaking stopped.  Ed's integrity was a good root point for a new network in Tacoma, much as Scott was in Seattle a few year before.

The loan on 616 N Oakes was the first time I really negotiated on a loan.  The eventual APR was 4.075% with a 3.625% rate.  The down payment was 5%, so this included PMI.  The lender wasn't terribly competent.  The close date slipped twice.  Each time we had to go back to the seller and ask for an extension.  They could have used that to cancel the contract, which wouldn't have been great.  Because of oddities with the financing the final sales price ended up as $237,219.

An additional headache was the Washington has a transfer tax.  That's typically paid by the seller and in this case it was.  The lender was in NJ and kept adding it to various closing costs.  It was eventually paid by the seller as expected.

![616 - Cash Flow](/images/5/616%20-%20Cash%20Flow.png)

In 2017, the first tenant moved in, partway through the year.  His monthly rent was $1900.  That made the townhouse cash flow positive, impressive considering that it was recently bought with a 5% downpayment.

![616 - Model](/images/5/616%20-%20Model.png)

The ROE model this time looks a bit different.  As before, the time living in the townhouse has a dismal ROE because no rent is collected.  We could certainly adjust for this, but even with that adjustment there would still be an impact from the downpayment costs.  616 also had repair costs because of deferred maintenance in 2016.

In 2017, equity actually dropped.  These numbers are taken from Zillow.  Zillow creates its estimate based on similar sales.  In 2017, the most similar sale possible happened, Vanessa's poorly maintained townhouse for $220k.  The Zillow estimate doesn't factor in that there was missing drywall and a roof leak, so the value of this unit was negatively impacted.

The projections for ROE begin their inexorable march downward in 2018, starting at 82% and eventually dropping to 10.72% once the loan is paid off in 2046.  This is an amazing return, the result of high rents, good financing and a reatively low purchase price.  The only real concern with this property is the inevitable $10k-$20k cost to deal with the radiant heat.
