"You can fondle the cube, but it will not respond." -Warren Buffet

In early 2013 I was living in the Hilton Midtown in New York.  It was limbo.  I was waiting for a formal transfer to come through, working for a guy named Mike, who I deeply respect.  Suddenly everything changed.  I wasn't going to work for Mike anymore, instead John, who would report to Mike.  John was new at the company and didn't like me much.  He didn't think I could do the job and didn't want me working for him.  Then I found out Mike was on his way out.  There were other options at TIBCO, but it was past time to move on.

During my time in London, I'd worked closely with Andrew.  He'd helped sponsor my move there in the first place.  Andrew had in turn been sponsored and perhaps mentored a bit by Robin.  I knew Robin vaguely, but mostly by reputation.  He was now CEO at Terracotta.  At one point Terracotta had been a hot software startup.  Then it got bought by Software AG.  The plan at the time time was to run it somewhat independently.  There was a promise I've grown to mistrust, "get the best of both worlds - work at a startup, but with all the resources of a big company."

On a recommendation from Robin, I joined Terracotta.  Roughly six months later it was merged into Software AG.  So much for startup culture...  On the bright side, there were a ton of ex-TIBCO people at Software AG since the companies were direct competitors.  So, it felt familiar and I could be effective easily.  The job also allowed me to move back to Seattle.  With Terracotta my role was national, but that quickly transitioned into a regional role covering the Western US with Software AG.

In April 2013, Graham was still in the 1420 Terry condo, while I slept on the air bed in the living room.  This wasn't a huge issue as I was traveling an enormous amount for work.

I'd been getting updates on the rental waiting list.  Apparently I was pretty near the top.  Mortgage rates had briefly spiked, but then dropped back to 3.5%.  I decided to double down on my interest rate bet by buying another property.  My thinking at the time was that I'd get an inexpensive condo.  I could then live in that for a year as required by the mortgage before buying a more permanent house.  That would allow me to get a little more leverage at this amazing rate.

I reached out to Chad at Redfin.  They'd changed their model yet again.  He passed me on to an independent contractor, Nikki.  Her job seemed to be solely to show places to prospective buyers.  There were about 10 condos I wanted to look at.  The Redfin model at the time only allowed five to be looked at in one tour.  I'd have to schedule a second time to see the additional ones.  I grudgingly agreed and pruned my list a bit.

![1610 Belmont](/images/3/1610%20Belmont.jpg)

I met Nikki at [1610 Belmont Ave, #512](https://www.zillow.com/homes/1610-Belmont-Ave-Apt-512,-Seattle,-WA-98122_rb/).  It'd been listed for $275k five days before.  It's a 550 sqft 1 bedroom.  The building was new.  The location was great.  The finishes were fine, but the windows looked straight into the condo next door.  The shades in that picture are drawn for a reason.  Today, in 2017, Zillow estimates it as worth $450k.

I then walked downstairs with Nikki where I was informed she couldn't drive me to the next property because she didn't have the proper insurance.  She suggested I walk.  All that made the decision to fire Redfin pretty easy.  

The Redfin website is amazing and I still use it when searching properties.  The rebate model is pretty good, but you can negotiate that with an agent yourself.  Eventually they'll probably stop pivoting strategies every 12 months and settle down a bit.  I wouldn't be surprised if they disrupt the industry substantially at that point.  The mortgage industry has way too many hand signed pieces of paper.  DocuSign is a band aid on it.  I suspect the longer term solution is going to be an electronic network that supports listings, offers, underwriting, settlement and maybe even insurance claims.  Existing solutions like ACH, SWIFT and FIX all offer insight into how this could be done.

I'd been bitching to Scott about Redfin for ages.  We'd repeatedly had an over beer conversation about the conflicting incentives for agents.  A buyer wants to get the right home at the best possible price.  Given the high transaction costs, rational buyers review the alternatives patiently before transacting.  Agents on the other hand want the deal to close as quickly as possible for as much as possible.  This maximizes their commission.

Sellers have different incentives, but they aren't aligned with agents either.  A rational seller wants to sell for as much as possible.  If a mortgage payment is $2k, waiting an extra month to net an additional $10k in sales price is probably sensible.  Not so for a real estate agent.  While they'll net some additional commission, their goal is to transact as quickly as possible.  That's true, even if it means leaving money on the table because there's always another deal they need to shift their focus to.

For instance, agents really like to list properties below market value.  In the listing they'll then put some language like "reviewing offers next Tuesday."  The hope here is that they can get several offers in, then play them against each other to create a bidding war.  Sometimes it works and the bidding war can benefit a client.  However, this approach has a tendency to leave money on the table if a bidding war doesn't happen.  Regardless, it helps ensure a sale will happen quickly.

Scott proposed a way to get around these misaligned incentives.  Agents should be compensated with an hourly rate and no commission.  The buyer would pay their agent.  The seller would pay their agent.

Another lawyer Scott knew, Kirk, ran a small firm called Hampton West.  Scott introduced me to Kirk, who introduced me to his partner Chris.  We negotiated a commission rebate and were on our way.

![2100 3rd](/images/3/211%20Summit.jpg)

In my endless wandering of Capitol Hill, I'd attended an open house at [211 N Summit](https://www.zillow.com/homes/211-Summit-Ave-E-.num.-n.dash.401,-Seattle,-WA-98102_rb/).  It was a somewhat dated condo building.  The unit was a penthouse 700sqft 1 bedroom with a fireplace, amazing views of the city and a rooftop deck nearly as large as the unit itself.  The asking price was $299,950.

Before I ever met Chris in person, he helped me put together an offer for asking price.  The open house I'd attended was very busy.  The unit eventually went for $325k with 8 competing offers.  One mystery is that they never countered.  I would have happily gotten into a bidding war for that condo, perhaps even exceeding the $325k price.  

I've seen this behavior again and again.  If I were the seller in this case, I'd be outraged.  By not coming back to me, the seller left money on the table in both the form of a potentially higher offer from me as well as a potentially even higher counter from one of their other buyers.  Given that they received 8 offers in less than a week, the unit was probably underpriced as well.

Today, in 2017, Zillow puts 211 Summit at $496k.

![2100 3rd](/images/3/2100%203rd.jpg)

I gave Chris a list of 14 properties that grew to 22 as we searched around.  He checked which ones had rental caps and we disqualified those.  After looking at a bunch of places, I settled on [2100 3rd Ave #1204](https://www.zillow.com/homes/for_sale/2100-3rd-Ave-.num.1204,-seattle_rb).  This was a 783 sqft 1 bedroom in a building from 1973.  The building had dated a bit, but it was right downtown and had good views. The asking price was $248,000.  We put together an offer for asking and went back and forth with the sellers agent a bit.   The condo eventually sold for $248,500.  This is another case where I really don't understand what happened.  The seller could easily have negotiated me up using their other offer.  They didn't even try.

As we were negotiating the seller raised the issue of my proposed 5% down financing.  I suspect that's why they didn't counter.  Apparently the other offer had a bigger downpayment.  

Buyers often complain about losing to all cash offers.  All cash offers are preferable to ones that include financing because they're less risky.  Sellers seem to overestimate the cost of that risk enormously.  The most significant cost of a failed offer is a month or two of mortgage payments while you find a new offer.  For the sufficiently paranoid, another cost related to the possibility the market will fall apart while you're waiting for the replacement offer could be incorporated as well.  

If, as a seller, you're leaving anything over 2x your mortgage payment on the table so you can take a cash offer, you're probably acting against your own interest.  However, your actions are probably well aligned to the interests of your agent, who wants to see you transact quickly.  In fact, a cash offer, will probably speed time to closing as there's no need to wait for loan approvals.  My suspicion is that the preference in the market for cash offers is closely tied to bad advice from listing agents.

After 2100 3rd went wrong, I moved on to an offer on [1410 Belmont](https://www.redfin.com/WA/Seattle/1410-Belmont-Ave-98122/home/35624720).  This was a strange little co-op.  It's a 500 sqft 1 bedroom in a building built in 1900.  The location is amazing, right in the middle of the Pike/Pine corridor.  It appears to have been built as apartments back then.  The complex consists of two buildings, each with 4 units.  Part of my scheme with 1410 Belmont was that I might be able to slowly take over the co-op by buying all the units.

We went back and forth with the listing agent for a bit on the specifics of the offer.  Somewhere in there the owner rented the place out for a year, without informing her agent first.  Everyone seemed pretty pissed off about that one.  The listing agent took it off market.

After that there was another condo at [2500 Western](https://www.redfin.com/WA/Seattle/2500-Western-Ave-98121/unit-412/home/2078921).  It was a short sale.  There was an enormous amount of back and forth with the listing agent and mortgage broker to include specific wording in the preapproval letter.  Once that was finally completed and the offer submitted, we found out I'd lost to an all cash offer above the asking price.  Once again there was no counter.  In this case it wasn't an individual losing money by accepting the first offer, but a bank.  The sale price was $134,900 in 2013.  Redfin now estimates it as worth $331,447.

Then there was an offer on a condo at 412 11th ave.  A special assessment was going on and the seller eventually decided they weren't accepting offers.  The building has since been bulldozed and replaced by a new development.

On 4/21/17, Chris mailed me about a condo we'd looked at previously.  [2324 1st, #413](https://www.redfin.com/WA/Seattle/2324-1st-Ave-98121/unit-413/home/61969) is a 420 sqft studio.  You can see the Space Needle and the Monorail out of the extremely large windows.  Some pretty awful things had been done to it, including a horrible olive drab paint job.  It also had three different kinds of flooring, which was pretty impressive for 420 sqft.  Thanks to all that, and some truly terrible pictures in the MLS, it'd been sitting on the market for a while.

![2324 - Bedroom](/images/3/2324%20-%20Bedroom.jpg)

The previous owner had bought it in December of 2007 for $250k.  That was impressively bad timing, but an interesting demonstration of how lending was still merrily happening even after things went wrong for Bear Stearns.

Initially the condo was listed at $237,800 in March, 2013 as a bank owned short sale.  By April the price had been adjusted down to $209,900.  That price was already approved by the bank, they just needed an offer.  We put one together and it was quickly accepted.

The offer was submitted on 4/25/13.  The deal didn't close until 6/27/13, over two months later.  The proposed financing was 5% down.  I went back to the same lender I'd used to finance 1420 Terry, Roundpoint.  The loan officer I'd previously worked with was nowhere to be found.  Instead, there was a new guy named Matthew.

Paul did the inspection.  The full report runs to 18 pages for 420 sqft.  It's thorough.  The most severe issue he uncovered was a drip from the kitchen sink drain.

As the loan was making it's way through underwriting, Roundpoint flagged it.  Because this condo was less valuable than the 1420 Terry condo, Roundpoint wouldn't underwrite it as a primary residence.  I got an affidavit saying I intended to occupy the condo, but it still wasn't enough.  The was a bit of an oddity.  It still had the 3.5% rate for a primary residence, Roundpoint required 20% down.  

The loan had another odd term, requiring me to live in the condo for six months.  In other cases I'd seen, that requirement is for a year.

It was late in the process and there was no time to switch to another lender.  I needed to come up with $209,900 * 15% = $31,485 in a few days.  Two unpleasant choices presented themselves.  One was to raid a retirement account.  Fortunately I had enough sense not to do that.  The other possibility was to close out a futures position that I was convinced was about to turn in my favor.  It was, of course, down rather significantly at the time.

I closed out the position.  Almost immediately after things swung back in my favor.  Oh well.

One of my many pet peeves with the home buying process is the utter uselessness of the appraisal.  It has a funny way of coming in just above the asking price.  The appraisal is paid for by the buyer, so the incentives are perhaps not entirely pure.  It's a bit reminiscent of the work the ratings agencies do for the big banks.  In this case the sale price was $209,900.  It appraised for $210,000.  That's especially odd given that back in 2007 it probably appraised for $250k.

The rest of the loan process went relatively smoothly.  The larger downpayment changed the characteristics of the property as an investment in a significant way.  To see how, let's consider the model we developed in the previous chapter that includes expenses, rent, etc.

![2324 - Model 1](/images/3/2324%20-%20Model.png)

ROE gets off to a pretty rough start.  This is because Zillow estimates the value of the condo dropped in 2014 before climbing in later years.  The model shows excellent returns in the years that have elapsed to date with a three year run in excess of 70% per year.

Return in the more distant future approaches 6.8%.

Twice now, first at 1420 Terry and now at 2324 1st, I've presented a model with a disastrous first year where a big pile of cash is provided.  After that things go quite well.

Consider the average return from 2013 to 2017.  During that period the sum of cash flow was approximately -$67k. At the end of that period equity totaled approximately $181k.  That gives an annual return of 22%.  

There are a wide variety of reasons why a growth rate like that is unsustainable, but it's still really nice to get it for a few years.  In addition, and not included in the model, I got to live in the condo for a while and received tax advantages while doing so.

![2324 - Model 1 Cash Flow](/images/3/2324%20-%20Model%20Cash%20Flow.png)

The real cash flow to date has been marginal.  It should be positive but vacancy as tenants turn over and increasing overhead have kept pace with rent increases to date.

![2324 - ROE Downpayment](/images/3/2324%20-%20ROE%20Downpayment.png)

It's hard to calculate exactly how much Roundpoint's decision to change the rules at the last moment impacted me.  I have $181k in equity today whereas with a 5% downpayment I would only have $153k in equity.  However, I would have needed less cash, only $44k rather than $67k.  The return to date would also have been 28% rather than 22%. The return projected into the future would stay higher until the loan is paid off as a result of the greater leverage.

![2324 - Remodel](/images/3/2324%20-%20Remodel.jpg)

About a month before the closing, Mike came by to take a look at the place and put together estimates.  I wanted the floor redone with a single kind of flooring.  Similarly the walls needed painted white.  Just cleaning up those two things had a huge impact on the condo.  Mike began work shortly after closing and I was able to move in at the end of July.

I lived there for six months and rented it out for $1298 in January 2014.  The first tenant at 2324 was Erik.  He was amazing on paper and in person.  He inspected the condo with his parents in tow.  I think they were from Ohio.  It was all very wholesome and midwestern.  Unfortunately for me Erik was quite upwardly mobile.  After 10 months he asked if he could break his lease.  I agreed, provided he found a new tenant willing to pay $1398.

This is one of the perverse realities of real estate.  The tenant you probably want has a less than perfect credit score, income sufficient to pay the rent but not far in excess of it and perhaps some additional factors weighing them down that are preventing them from buying their own place.  Tenants who are advancing rapidly in their career or who are briefly passing through the city are going to churn.  Churn means vacancy and that means lost rent.

Erik's successor, Meredith stayed for about two years.  When she moved out I listed the condo for $1600 and got a response from Chris.  It turned out he was the noisy upstairs neighbor that Meredith regularly complained about directly above in unit 513.  It had exactly the same floorplan.  The owner was selling that unit.  Chris provided the owner as a reference.  Speaking with her I found out he'd been paying $1800.  I may have underpriced the condo a bit at that time, but we'd verbally agreed $1600 and I didn't want to go back on my word.

Chris stayed a year.  I re-listed, bumping the rent to $1800 this time.  I didn't get any responses.  I gradually dropped the rent back down to $1600 at which point a new tenant, James, signed up.  That cost two months of vacancy.

2324 1st is in Belltown, a few blocks from clumps of Amazon buildings that have been popping up like mushrooms for the last decade all over South Lake Union.  Mixed in with those are a bunch of mid-rise apartment buildings.  In 2017 a bunch of them finally came online.  I suspect that caused a glut in the market, making the rent at 2324 1st fall.

This was validated a bit speaking to prospective tenants who mentioned a variety of deals on brand new units including discounted initial rent much like I'd encountered in Dallas a few years before.  If you have good judgement, there seems to be a business in renting to tenants with less than stellar credit that those complexes won't touch.  So far things have worked out reasonably well, though I dread the things that can go wrong - evictions, meth labs and so on.

2324 1st has been a great investment so far.  It has low maintenance costs, is easy to rent and has given outsized returns.  To me, it's a model of what to look for in a real estate investment.
